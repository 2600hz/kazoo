--------------------------

This release contains backwards incompatible changes.

 * New and more efficient couchbeam_changes API, we now parse json
   stream instead of the try catch steps we used before. 
 * New and more efficient couchbeam_view API. we now parse json
   stream instead of getting all results. New couchbeam_view:stream and
   couchbeam_view fetch functions have been added. We also don't use
   any more a view record in other functions
 * HTTP functions have been moved to couchbeam_httpc modules
 * gen_changes behaviour has been updated to use the couchbeam_changes
   API. It's also abble to restart a lost connection for longpoll and
   continuous feeds.

Breaking Changes:

 * couchbeam:view and couchbeam:all_docs have been deprecated. Old views
   functions using the #view{} record from these functions have been
   moved in couchbeam_oldview module.
 * couchbeam:wait_changes, couchbeam:wait_changes_once,
   couchbeam:changes functions have been deprecated and are now replaced
   by couchbeam_changes:stream and couchbeam_changes:fetch functions.
