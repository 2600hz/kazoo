-module(file_handle_cache).

%% A File Handle Cache
%%
%% This extends a subset of the functionality of the Erlang file
%% module. In the below, we use "file handle" to specifically refer to
%% file handles, and "file descriptor" to refer to descriptors which
%% are not file handles, e.g. sockets.
%%
%% Some constraints
%% 1) This supports one writer, multiple readers per file. Nothing
%% else.
%% 2) Do not open the same file from different processes. Bad things
%% may happen, especially for writes.
%% 3) Writes are all appends. You cannot write to the middle of a
%% file, although you can truncate and then append if you want.
%% 4) Although there is a write buffer, there is no read buffer. Feel
%% free to use the read_ahead mode, but beware of the interaction
%% between that buffer and the write buffer.
%%
%% Some benefits
%% 1) You do not have to remember to call sync before close
%% 2) Buffering is much more flexible than with the plain file module,
%% and you can control when the buffer gets flushed out. This means
%% that you can rely on reads-after-writes working, without having to
%% call the expensive sync.
%% 3) Unnecessary calls to position and sync get optimised out.
%% 4) You can find out what your 'real' offset is, and what your
%% 'virtual' offset is (i.e. where the hdl really is, and where it
%% would be after the write buffer is written out).
%%
%% There is also a server component which serves to limit the number
%% of open file descriptors. This is a hard limit: the server
%% component will ensure that clients do not have more file
%% descriptors open than it's configured to allow.
%%
%% On open, the client requests permission from the server to open the
%% required number of file handles. The server may ask the client to
%% close other file handles that it has open, or it may queue the
%% request and ask other clients to close file handles they have open
%% in order to satisfy the request. Requests are always satisfied in
%% the order they arrive, even if a latter request (for a small number
%% of file handles) can be satisfied before an earlier request (for a
%% larger number of file handles). On close, the client sends a
%% message to the server. These messages allow the server to keep
%% track of the number of open handles. The client also keeps a
%% gb_tree which is updated on every use of a file handle, mapping the
%% time at which the file handle was last used (timestamp) to the
%% handle. Thus the smallest key in this tree maps to the file handle
%% that has not been used for the longest amount of time. This
%% smallest key is included in the messages to the server. As such,
%% the server keeps track of when the least recently used file handle
%% was used *at the point of the most recent open or close* by each
%% client.
%%
%% Note that this data can go very out of date, by the client using
%% the least recently used handle.
%%
%% When the limit is exceeded (i.e. the number of open file handles is
%% at the limit and there are pending 'open' requests), the server
%% calculates the average age of the last reported least recently used
%% file handle of all the clients. It then tells all the clients to
%% close any handles not used for longer than this average, by
%% invoking the callback the client registered. The client should
%% receive this message and pass it into
%% set_maximum_since_use/1. However, it is highly possible this age
%% will be greater than the ages of all the handles the client knows
%% of because the client has used its file handles in the mean
%% time. Thus at this point the client reports to the server the
%% current timestamp at which its least recently used file handle was
%% last used. The server will check two seconds later that either it
%% is back under the limit, in which case all is well again, or if
%% not, it will calculate a new average age. Its data will be much
%% more recent now, and so it is very likely that when this is
%% communicated to the clients, the clients will close file handles.
%% (In extreme cases, where it's very likely that all clients have
%% used their open handles since they last sent in an update, which
%% would mean that the average will never cause any file handles to
%% be closed, the server can send out an average age of 0, resulting
%% in all available clients closing all their file handles.)
%%
%% Care is taken to ensure that (a) processes which are blocked
%% waiting for file descriptors to become available are not sent
%% requests to close file handles; and (b) given it is known how many
%% file handles a process has open, when the average age is forced to
%% 0, close messages are only sent to enough processes to release the
%% correct number of file handles and the list of processes is
%% randomly shuffled. This ensures we don't cause processes to
%% needlessly close file handles, and ensures that we don't always
%% make such requests of the same processes.
%%
%% The advantage of this scheme is that there is only communication
%% from the client to the server on open, close, and when in the
%% process of trying to reduce file handle usage. There is no
%% communication from the client to the server on normal file handle
%% operations. This scheme forms a feed-back loop - the server does
%% not care which file handles are closed, just that some are, and it
%% checks this repeatedly when over the limit.
%%
%% Handles which are closed as a result of the server are put into a
%% "soft-closed" state in which the handle is closed (data flushed out
%% and sync'd first) but the state is maintained. The handle will be
%% fully reopened again as soon as needed, thus users of this library
%% do not need to worry about their handles being closed by the server
%% - reopening them when necessary is handled transparently.
%%
%% The server also supports obtain, release and transfer. obtain/{0,1}
%% blocks until a file descriptor is available, at which point the
%% requesting process is considered to 'own' more descriptor(s).
%% release/{0,1} is the inverse operation and releases previously obtained
%% descriptor(s). transfer/{1,2} transfers ownership of file descriptor(s)
%% between processes. It is non-blocking. Obtain has a
%% lower limit, set by the ?OBTAIN_LIMIT/1 macro. File handles can use
%% the entire limit, but will be evicted by obtain calls up to the
%% point at which no more obtain calls can be satisfied by the obtains
%% limit. Thus there will always be some capacity available for file
%% handles. Processes that use obtain are never asked to return them,
%% and they are not managed in any way by the server. It is simply a
%% mechanism to ensure that processes that need file descriptors such
%% as sockets can do so in such a way that the overall number of open
%% file descriptors is managed.
%%
%% The callers of register_callback/3, obtain, and the argument of
%% transfer are monitored, reducing the count of handles in use
%% appropriately when the processes terminate.
