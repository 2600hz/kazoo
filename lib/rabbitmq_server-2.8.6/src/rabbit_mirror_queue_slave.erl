    %% messages need requeuing. They might also be pending
    %% confirmation, and indeed they might also be pending arrival of

    %% affect confirmations: if the message was previously pending a
    %% confirmation then it still will be, under the same msg_id. So
    %% as a master, we need to be prepared to filter out the
    %% publication of said messages from the channel (is_duplicate
    %% (thus such requeued messages must remain in the msg_id_status
    %% (MS) which becomes seen_status (SS) in the master)).
    %%
    %% Then there are messages we already have in the queue, which are
    %% not currently pending acknowledgement:
    %% 1. Messages we've only received via gm:
    %%    Filter out subsequent publication from channel through
    %%    validate_message. Might have to issue confirms then or
    %%    later, thus queue_process state will have to know that
    %%    there's a pending confirm.
    %% 2. Messages received via both gm and channel:
    %%    Queue will have to deal with issuing confirms if necessary.
    %%
    %% MS contains the following three entry types:
    %%
    %% a) published:
    %%   published via gm only; pending arrival of publication from
    %%   channel, maybe pending confirm.
    %%
    %% b) {published, ChPid, MsgSeqNo}:
    %%   published via gm and channel; pending confirm.
    %%
    %% c) confirmed:
    %%   published via gm only, and confirmed; pending publication
    %%   from channel.
    %%
    %% d) discarded:
    %%   seen via gm only as discarded. Pending publication from
    %%   channel
    %%
    %% The forms a, c and d only, need to go to the master state
    %% seen_status (SS).
    %%
    %% The form b only, needs to go through to the queue_process
    %% state to form the msg_id_to_channel mapping (MTC).

    %% entries in MS.
