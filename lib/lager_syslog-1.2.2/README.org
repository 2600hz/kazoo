* Overview
  [[http://travis-ci.org/basho/lager_syslog][Travis-CI]] :: [[https://secure.travis-ci.org/basho/lager_syslog.png]]

  This is a syslog backend for [[https://github.com/basho/lager][Lager]]. It
  allows you to send messages out of lager and into the local syslog daemon.

* Configuration
  Configure a Lager handler like the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {lager_syslog_backend, [Identity, Facility, Level]}
#+END_EXAMPLE

  The Identity is the string to tag all messages with in syslog, usually the
  application's name. The facility is the facility to log to (see the syslog
  documentation for a list of these). The Level is the lager level at which the
  backend accepts messages (eg. using 'info' would send all messages at info
  level or above into syslog). While you can filter messages at the syslog
  level, it will improve performance if you filter in lager instead.

  An example for [[http://www.basho.com/products_riak_overview.php][riak]]
  would look something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {lager_syslog_backend, ["riak", local7, info]}
#+END_EXAMPLE

  If you want to log to multiple facilities at once, you can do something like
  the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {{lager_syslog_backend, "daemon facility"}, ["riak1", daemon, info]},
  {{lager_syslog_backend, ftp}, ["riak2", ftp, notice]},
#+END_EXAMPLE

  You MUST give each instance of the file backend its own identifier.

  Refer to Lager's documentation for futher information on configuring handlers.

* Troubleshooting
  There's not a lot to go wrong, but if you are not receiving messages, check
  your syslog config and read its manpage for more information. OS X, in
  particular, has a very strange default config where it drops messages below
  the 'info' level by default.
