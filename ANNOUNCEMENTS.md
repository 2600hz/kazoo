# Announcements for Kazoo

This file will serve as a reference point for upcoming announcements, both of the temporal nature (this library will be deprecated in 6 months) and version-specific (upgrading from X to Y will require A, B, and C).

## Versions

### 4.0

#### Erlang Version Support

Starting with Kazoo 4.0 Erlang support will target 18+ and will not be backward compatible with prior Erlang versions.

#### Consistent naming (removal of references to whistle)

All instances of whistle or variations such as wh_ have been replaced with kazoo or kz_.  This will include all maintenance functions as well as init.d/systemd scripts.  There is a script that can be used to assist with renaming and changing references in code `scripts/wh-to-kz.sh`.

#### Number Manager

Upgrading to 4.0 will shift number management from `core/whistle_number_manager` to `core/kazoo_number_manager`.
The upgrade process *should* be seamless from the user's perspective, with some exceptions:
* API calls for attachments and port requests all go to `cb_port_requests`

#### CouchDB

Upgrading will change the way Kazoo interacts with CouchDB (including deprecating using BigCouch and recommending CouchDB!). For most operations, nothing will be noticeably different.

#### Authorizing-ID

currently, inbound calls from carriers don't have a Authorizing-ID but if the device has a redirection the CDR will have the Authorizing-ID header. this will change in version 4 as we believe the inbound leg should not have the Authorizing-ID set, so the CDR for inbound call (leg a) will not have the Authorizing-ID.
The b-leg will have the Authorizing-ID set to the device that redirect the call.
Restrictions will still be applied based on the device that redirected the call.

#### Blacklist changes

In the 3.x series, a `raw_numbers` attribute was allowed, ostensibly to match anonymous caller IDs. This has been removed and a more proper solution has been put in place. You can still add anonymous caller ID to your blacklists, or you can configure the account/system to block them via the `block_anonymous_caller_id` key:

```shell
# Account
#> sup kapps_account_config set {ACCOUNT_ID} stepswitch block_anonymous_caller_id true
# System
#> sup kapps_config set_default stepswitch block_anonymous_caller_id true
```

#### Voicemail Messages

All new voicemail messages will be stored in the account MODbs. A new system configuration parameter `message_retention_duration` was added to support how many months of voicemail messages should be considered when accessing a voicemail box. Additionally, the v2 vmboxes API will no longer return the messages array and the manipulation in the messages array on the v1 vmboxes API is strongly discuraged. The existing messages API should be used to manage messages in a voicemail box. For more information about this change please see documentation for the new kazoo_voicemail core application and crossbar voicemail documentation.

#### Removing socket.io support from Websockets

The Blackhole application providing websocket support currently utilizes the socket.io client libraries.  Due to the poor support for this server side in Erlang as well as the judgement that this provides little benifit it has been removed.  The websockets now provide messaging without the socket.io overhead.  More documentation will be available shortly.  Please note that we still consider websockets beta functionality.

#### System media has been moved

The media prompts that we used to keep in the code repository for historical reasons has been moved the kazoo-prompts repository.

### 3.22

#### FreeSWITCH 1.4.26+ / 1.6+

To upgrade to Kazoo-FreeSWITCH 1.4.26+ or FreeSWITCH 1.6+ you must set the system_config/ecallmgr parameter `use_kazoo_dptools` to TRUE.  Failure to do so may cause inconsistent channel information among eCallMgr nodes connected to the same FreeSWITCH instance.  If you are using Kazoo-FreeSWITCH 1.4.x builds prior to .26 this parameter should be left as its default, FALSE.

#### Monster UI Enabled Applications

The enabled Monster UI applications were moved from an object on the account document to its own document with the id `apps_store`.  When you run `sup kapps_maintenance migrate` this will automatically preform this operation but until it is complete users logging into Monster UI may not see their previously enabled applications.  Once the migration is complete the change should be transparent to end-users.

#### Company Directory PDF

If you plan to support the new API to download the company directory as a PDF you will need to install 'htmldoc' on any server running crossbar.

#### Default WebRTC Port change

The default ports that Kamailio listens to for the WebRTC websocket have changed, this was due to a port conflict on all-in-one installs with TLS enabled Kazoo APIs. The standard HTTP websocket port was 8080 and is now 5064.  The TLS HTTP websocket port was 8443 and is now 5065.  If you would like to continue using the old ports please update "/etc/kazoo/kamailio/local.cfg" after an update to kazoo-configs 3.22.12+

## Upcoming

### May 2016

#### Deprecating `deps/mochiweb`

Most operations have been moved to the Cowboy or Cowlib projects. We will formally remove mochiweb from `deps/`. If you maintain code apart from Kazoo that uses mochiweb, please either covert to equivalent functionality with Cowboy/Cowlib or plan how you'll build your custom code with your own dependency of mochiweb.

#### Deprecating `deps/exmpp`

exmpp library has problems restarting. it will be replaced by `deps/escalus`

#### Deprecating `deps/ibrowse`
`ibrowse` will be replaced by `core/kazoo_web/kz_http` which is using Erlang `httpc`. `kz_http` is the new HTTP client module now and the previous `kz_http` module is renamed to `kz_http_util`.

If you maintain code apart from Kazoo that uses `ibrowse`, please either covert to equivalent functionality with `kz_http`/`httpc` or plan how youâ€™ll build your custom code with your own dependency of `ibrowse`.
