Sending of erroneous hold when second agent on phone with second caller

Race condition when agent has answered leg, send acceptance before uuid_bridge.

Check accept (are you magical) for call-id of current call; if same, accept and move on?

Agent manager should periodically query logged in agents and logout those that aren't on the system anymore.

** Scenario 1
 * No agents logged in
 * Customer calls in...eventually hangs up
 * Agent logs in
 * Agent receives ghost call

Call waiting log isn't updating
