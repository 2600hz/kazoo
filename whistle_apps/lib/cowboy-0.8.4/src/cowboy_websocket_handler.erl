%% @doc Handler for HTTP WebSocket requests.
%%
%% WebSocket handlers must implement five callbacks: <em>init/3</em>,
%% <em>websocket_init/3</em>, <em>websocket_handle/3</em>,
%% <em>websocket_info/3</em> and <em>websocket_terminate/3</em>.
%% These callbacks will only be called if the connection is upgraded
%% to WebSocket in the HTTP handler's <em>init/3</em> callback.
%% They are then called in that order, although <em>websocket_handle/3</em>
%% will be called for each packet received, and <em>websocket_info</em>
%% for each message received.
%%
%% <em>websocket_init/3</em> is meant for initialization. It receives
%% information about the transport and protocol used, along with the handler
%% options from the dispatch list. You can define a request-wide state here.
%% If you are going to want to compact the request, you should probably do it
%% here.
%%
%% <em>websocket_handle/3</em> receives the data from the socket. It can reply
%% something, do nothing or close the connection.
%%
%% <em>websocket_info/3</em> receives messages sent to the process. It has
%% the same reply format as <em>websocket_handle/3</em> described above. Note
%% that unlike in a <em>gen_server</em>, when <em>websocket_info/3</em>
%% replies something, it is always to the socket, not to the process that
%% originated the message.
%%
%% <em>websocket_terminate/3</em> is meant for cleaning up. It also receives
%% the request and the state previously defined, along with a reason for
%% termination.
%%
%% All of <em>websocket_init/3</em>, <em>websocket_handle/3</em> and
%% <em>websocket_info/3</em> can decide to hibernate the process by adding
%% an extra element to the returned tuple, containing the atom
%% <em>hibernate</em>. Doing so helps save memory and improve CPU usage.
