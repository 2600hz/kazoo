### Cloud-Based Telecommunications For Everyone

Welcome to Kazoo, an ambitious project to bring cloud-based VoIP and telecommunications to everyone. Our goal is to provide the world with a free, open telecommunications software platform. Released under the [OSI-approved MPL 1.1 open source software license](//opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.1), we're building upon strong FOSS components like [GNU](//www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [Erlang](//www.erlang.org/), [FreeSWITCH](//freeswitch.org), [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), and [RabbitMQ](//www.rabbitmq.com). Our project is a great example of the wonderful things that can happen when software is open.

### What is Kazoo?

Kazoo is an API-based platform that lets you use your existing phones,
programming languages and IT skills to build voice, video and SMS services. We
focus on building a simple, powerful communications platform and let you focus
on marketing, servicing and integrating communications with your clients
systems.

Dubbed a "scalable, distributed, cloud-based" telephony platform, Kazoo
provides simple to use, consistent API so that people who know little about
building telecom systems can still dive in and utilize the power of the phone
network. In practical terms that means you can create your own phone service
in the cloud. Or on a server in your mother's basement. Or in a distributed
cluster of servers around the globe. It's up to you.

### Who is 2600Hz?

We're a bunch of crazy engineers who dreamt of a world where business
communications wasn't so complicated. So we abandoned the old infrastructure
altogether and teamed up to build a new platform from the ground up that would
take out all the complexity while giving the power of customization to you,
the user.

Led by the founders of successful commercial and open-source telephony and
networking projects, our carrier-grade software helps people create solid
voice, video and SMS solutions that work. We provide you with the open-source
infrastructure to run your own hosted PBX service, conferencing platform or
any API-powered VoIP service that scales as your company grows!

We are an exciting team of experienced and knowledgeable thought leaders in
the enterprise communications space. Our experience ranges from hosting and
managing services to carrier-grade termination, software design and
professional services. Let us know how we can help you and, in return, we will
ensure 2600Hz is always leading the way in cloud telecom.
