# Ecallmgr Maintenance commands

Here's a run down of the available SUP commands for manipulating ecallmgr!

All commands should be prefixed by `sup -n ecallmgr ecallmgr_maintenance`. So if the command is listed as `list_fs_nodes`, the full command you would actually run from the command line is `sup -n ecallmgr ecallmgr_maintenance list_fs_nodes`.

!!!note `-n {NODE}` should be specified anytime the Erlang VM is *not* named `kazoo_apps`. Traditionally ecallmgr has run in its own Erlang VM named `ecallmgr`. This setup is no longer a requirement; adjust SUP's `-n` accordingly if you run differently.
