 *** Setup SSL support for Media_Mgr ***

 * All commands are run from kazoo_apps/apps/media_mgr/priv/ssl/ *

Create the root key (skip if you have a root key already that you want to use):

$ openssl genrsa -out 2600hzCA.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
.............+++
......................................................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)

Sign the root key (fill out a questionnaire):

$ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key 2600hzCA.key -days 1024 -out 2600hzCA.pem
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Francisco
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:2600Hz
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:api.2600hz.com
Email Address []:

Create a certificate (cert):

$ openssl genrsa -out media_mgr.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
.......+++
......+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)

Remove the need for a passphrase:

$ openssl rsa -in media_mgr.key -out media_mgr.pem
writing RSA key

Now generate the certificate signing request (CSR):

$ openssl req -new -key media_mgr.key -out media_mgr.csr
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Francisco
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:2600Hz
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:api.2600hz.com
Email Address []:

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:

Be sure, when answering the "Common Name" question to put either your FQDN or IP address that will show in the browser.

Now let's sign the CSR:

$ openssl x509 -req -in media_mgr.csr -CA 2600hzCA.pem -CAkey 2600hzCA.key -CAcreateserial -out media_mgr.crt -days 500
Signature ok
subject=/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=2600Hz/CN=thinky64.2600hz.com
Getting CA Private Key

And finally, generate the self-signed certificate:

$ openssl x509 -req -days 60 -in media_mgr.csr -signkey media_mgr.key -out media_mgr.crt
Signature ok
subject=/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=2600Hz/CN=thinky64.2600hz.com
Getting Private key

Now modify the "media_mgr" doc in the "system_config" database with the following values:

"default":{
  "ssl_port":"24518"
  ,"ssl_cert":"priv/ssl/media_mgr.crt"
  ,"ssl_key":"priv/ssl/media_mgr.key"
}

Start media_mgr. You can now test your new SSL-enabled APIs via:
