# EDR

TLDR: See recipes at the bottom for ways to use EDR.

## Description

This app is responsible for getting EDR events (see kazoo_edr) out of Kazoo. It must be started per
kazoo node you wish to receive events from.

## Backends

The EDR app is essentially a collection of backends. Each backend will receive EDR events matching
a binding, and send them somewhere else (usually out of Kazoo).

Backends are registered in system_config/edr.

### General registered backend configuration options

Schema for edr system_config

Key | Description | Type | Default | Required
--- | ----------- | ---- | ------- | --------
`backends.[].bindings.[].account_id` | The account id to receive events from. If not specified or * then events for all accounts will be received | `string()` | `*` | `false`
`backends.[].bindings.[].app_name` | Which apps should we receive events from? If not specified or * then events for all apps will be received | `string()` | `*` | `false`
`backends.[].bindings.[].exact_severity` | If true, then only events with severity exactly matching the severity field will be received. If false then more severe events will also be received | `boolean()` | `false` | `false`
`backends.[].bindings.[].exact_verbosity` | If true, then only events with verbosity exactly matching the verbosity field will be received. If false then less verbose events will also be received | `boolean()` | `false` | `false`
`backends.[].bindings.[].include_descendants` | Should we receive events relating to descendant accounts if an account is specified? | `boolean()` | `false` | `false`
`backends.[].bindings.[].severity` | What severity are we interested in events for? | `string('ok' | 'warning' | 'critical')` | `ok` | `false`
`backends.[].bindings.[].verbosity` | What verbosity are we interested in events for? | `string('trace' | 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error' | 'fatal')` | `info` | `false`
`backends.[].bindings` | The types of events the backend should be notified about | `array(object())` |   | `true`
`backends.[].enabled` | Should the backend be started on edr app start? | `boolean()` | `true` | `true`
`backends.[].name` | A unique identifier for the backend | `string(1..)` |   | `true`
`backends.[].options.formatter.options` | Options passed on to the formatter module. These vary by module | `object()` |   | `false`
`backends.[].options.formatter.type` | The formatter module to be used (e.g. json refers to edr_fmt_json.erl) | `string('json')` |   | `false`
`backends.[].options.formatter` | Output format configuration which is used by some (but not all) backends | `object()` |   | `false`
`backends.[].options` | Options passed on to the backend module. These vary by module | `object()` |   | `false`
`backends.[].type` | The backend module to be used (e.g. amqp refers to edr_be_amqp.erl) | `string('amqp' | 'file' | 'http')` |   | `true`
`backends` | Registered edr backends | `array(object())` | `[]` | `false`

### Backend types

#### AMQP (edr_be_amqp)

This module forwards each event to RabbitMQ for use across nodes. kapi_edr_amqp can be used to bind to these events.
The routing key used is the same as that which is used by edr_bindings for consistency `edr.{SEVERITY}.{VERBOSITY}.{ACCOUNT_ID}.{APP_NAME}`.

There are configuration options yet, however a configurable routing key would be useful in future.

#### file (edr_be_file)

This module outputs each received event to a line in a log file. Each line is formatted by the specified formatter.
The configuration options are as follows:
- path (required): The path to the file. Ensure file (or directory, if the file does not exist) has the correct permissions
- formatter: Configuration as to how to format each event. This defaults to JSON with the default options.

#### HTTP (edr_be_http)

This module sends out a HTTP request for each EDR event it receives.
The configuration options are as follows:
- url (required): The URL the request will be sent to
- method: The HTTP method the request should use. Valid options are `put`, `post`, and `patch`. This defaults to `post`.
- headers: A JSON object containing headers and their values
- async: Should the request be asynchronous? Currently only `false` is implemented.
- connect_timeout: Connection timeout in milliseconds
- timeout: Request timeout in milliseconds
- formatter: Configuration as to how to format each event. Defaults to json with the default options.

### Formatters

A formatter is responsible for taking an event and formatting it for a backend. This is not configurable for every backend.

#### json (edr_fmt_json)

The configuration options are as follows:
- include_metadata: If set to `true` the output will be the whole EDR event. If set to `false` the output will just be the body. Defaults to `true`.
- normalize: Should the metadata fields be normalized to snake case? Defaults to `true`
- pretty: Should the output be nicely formatted? Defaults to `false`

## Sup commands

- `sup edr_maintenance register_backend {NAME} [{TYPE}] [{JSON_OPTS}] [{JSON_BINDINGS}] [{ENABLED}]`:
    Register a backend in the system_config, and start it if it is enabled. It is probably easier to use the system_config API and run `sup edr_maintenance enable_backend {NAME}` if you wish to specify options or bindings.

- `sup edr_maintenance delete_backend {NAME}`:
    The opposite of `register_backend`. Stop the backend if it is running, and remove it from the the system_config.

- `sup edr_maintenance enable_backend {NAME}`
    Start the backend, and enable it if it isn't already enabled.

- `sup edr_maintenance disable_backend {NAME}`
    Stop the backend, and disable it if it isn't already disabled.

- `sup edr_maintenance registered_backends`
    Show the configured backends.

## Recipes

Practical uses of EDR. It would be great if people could submit PRs with their configurations for other people to use.

### Multiple logs with different verbosities

#### system_config/edr:
```json
{
   "backends": [
       {
           "name": "debug_log",
           "type": "file",
           "options": {
               "path": "/var/log/kazoo/edr_debug.log"
           },
           "bindings": [
               {
                   "account_id": "*",
                   "include_descendants": false,
                   "app_name": "*",
                   "severity": "ok",
                   "exact_severity": false,
                   "verbosity": "debug",
                   "exact_verbosity": false
               }
           ],
           "enabled": true
       },
       {
           "name": "info_log",
           "type": "file",
           "options": {
               "path": "/var/log/kazoo/edr_info.log"
           },
           "bindings": [
               {
                   "account_id": "*",
                   "include_descendants": false,
                   "app_name": "*",
                   "severity": "ok",
                   "exact_severity": false,
                   "verbosity": "info",
                   "exact_verbosity": false
               }
           ],
           "enabled": true
       }
   ]
}
```

### EDR over Blackhole

This involves forwarding EDR events specific to an account over AMQP, which are then pushed over websockets with Blackhole.
The binding key is `edr.{SEVERITY}.{VERBOSITY}.{APP_NAME}`. Only events where the account_id matches that associated with the auth token will be received.

Note: You can request events with a verbosity or severity greater than what edr_be_amqp is bound to, however you won't receive any of them.

#### system_config/edr:
```json
{
   "backends": [
       {
           "name": "amqp",
           "type": "amqp",
           "options": {
           },
           "bindings": [
               {
                   "account_id": "*",
                   "include_descendants": false,
                   "app_name": "*",
                   "severity": "ok",
                   "exact_severity": false,
                   "verbosity": "info",
                   "exact_verbosity": false
               }
           ],
           "enabled": true
       }
    ]
}
```

### EDR events to HTTPBin

An example of sending EDR events over HTTP.

               "headers": {
                   "Content-Type": "application/json"
               }
           },
           "bindings": [
               {
                   "account_id": "*",
                   "include_descendants": false,
                   "app_name": "*",
                   "severity": "ok",
                   "exact_severity": false,
                   "verbosity": "info",
                   "exact_verbosity": false
               }
           ],
           "enabled": true
       }
    ]
}
```
