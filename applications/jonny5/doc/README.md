# Jonny5

Jonny5 maintains the current state of call limits as applied to accounts and their resellers.

Accounts can have a number of limits applied to them when placing calls:

- Trunk-based: Inbound, outbound, two-way, burst, bundled
- Credit-based: Prepay, postpay
- Allotments: Minutes in monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, or minutely buckets

Each leg of a call is then evaluated and tracked by jonny5 to ensure an account (and their reseller) stay within their configured limits.
