# Hot or Not *Call rating*

This application serves `rate_req` AMQP requests.

Rates are stored in a system-wide "ratedeck" database.

Each rate is separate document:
```JSON
{
    "_id": "f36cac061205f7a0f7fde6b4d3370bf9",
    "_rev": "1-1b67fb507c69c35200178a9b1e0e6cfc",
    "routes": [
        "^\\+?1.+$"
    ],
    "weight": "1",
    "rate_name": "outbound_US_1",
    "pvt_type": "rate",
    "prefix": "1",
    "rate_cost": "1.27",
    "ratedeck_name": "ratedeck_1",
    "iso_country_code": "US",
    "description": "USA prefix 1",
    "direction": "outbound",
    "rate_increment": "60",
    "rate_minimum": "60",
    "rate_nocharge_time": "0",
    "options": [
        "Opt1",
        "Opt2"
    ]
}
```

Schema for these rate documents is described in the [rates](../../crossbar/doc/rates.md#schema) reference doc.

## System Configuration

Key | Description | Type | Default
--- | ----------- | ---- | -------
`default_rate_cost` | Cost used when `rate_cost` is not defined in rate | `float` | `0.0`
`default_rate_increment` | Increment call duration when `rate_increment` is not defined in rate | `integer` | `60`
`default_rate_minimum` | Minimum call duration when `rate_minimum` is not defined in rate | `integer` | `60`
`default_rate_nocharge_time` | No charge time when `rate_nocharge_time`  is not defined in rate | `integer` | `0`
`default_rate_surcharge` | Surcharge used when `rate_surcharge` is not defined in rate | `float` | `0.0`
`filter_list.[]` |  | `string` |
`filter_list` | List additional filters (after prefix match) | `array(string)` | `["direction", "route_options", "routes"]`
`sort_by_weight` | Sort matched filters by `weight`(`true`) or by `rate_cost` (`false`) | `boolean` | `true`
`use_trie` | Use in-memory prefix dictionary for search rates | `boolean` | `false`

## Using the Trie

Rate lookups, by default, will use the CouchDB view `rates/lookup` and a list of prefixes generated by the dialed number to find any matching rates in the database. This is generally "fast enough" for most purposes. However, if the cluster is doing a lot of rate lookups, it may make sense to preload the rate table into memory for fast lookups. For reference, the trie implementation was ~128x faster in testing.

Starting the 'hon_trie' process will result in increased memory usage (~115 bytes per prefix in the database) on the VMs running hotornot. It would be advisable, if you have large ratedecks, to run a VM with just hotornot running to ensure memory is allocated properly.

To enable the trie, update the `system_config`: `sup kapps_config set_default hotornot use_trie true` and restart any VMs running hotornot: `sup kapps_controller restart_app hotornot`

## Filters

`filter_list` option is used to define additional filters when matching rates.

### direction

If `direction` filter defined in `filter_list` then "Direction" value from rate request compared with `direction` value in rates. Undefined value in rate means "match any direction".

### route_options

If `route_options` filter defined in `filter_list` then "Options", "Outbound-Flags" and resource ID from rate request compared with `options` value in rates. Rate matched when all flags in "Options", "Outbound-Flags" and resource ID exist in `options` list in rate. Empty or undefined `options` list in rate means "match any route options".

### routes

If `routes` filter defined in `filter_list` then "To-DID" from rate request compared with list of regexes in `routes` value of rates. Rate matched if any of regexes matched. Empty regexes list or undefined value in rate means "match nobody" and this rate will never be used.

### ratedeck_name

If `ratedeck_name` filter defined in `filter_list` then ratedeck assigned to account compared with `ratedeck_name` value of rates. Ratedeck name assigned to account via service plan. More info [here](../../../core/kazoo_services/doc/ratedeck.md). If rate request doesn't have "Account-ID" or account doesn't have ratedeck name in their service plan, then it match rates with undefined `ratedeck_name` value.

### reseller

If the `reseller` filter is defined in `filter_list`, then the reseller's account ID is compared with the `account_id` value of the rates. If rate request doesn't have "Account-ID" then it matches rates with undefined `account_id` value.

### version

If `version` filter defined in `filter_list` then `rate_version` from `system_config/hotornot` compared with `rate_version` value of rates.
