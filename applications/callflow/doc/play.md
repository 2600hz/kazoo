`skip_module` | When set to true this callflow action is skipped, advancing to the wildcard branch (if any) | `boolean()` |   | `false` |  
`terminators.[]` |   | `string()` |   | `false` |

#### Loop Count

If you want to play the media a number of times, include `loop_count` to do so.

#### Endless Playback

Endless playback is exactly that - playback of the media will not stop on the channel until the channel is hung up. The media is uninterruptible.

`endless_playback=true` takes precedence over `loop_count>0` if both are included.
