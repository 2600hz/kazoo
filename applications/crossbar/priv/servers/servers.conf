%% The templates used here are a erlang implentation of the django
%% templates.  See: http://code.google.com/p/erlydtl/wiki/TagsAndFilters
%% for details.  
%% If the template is provided as a binary:
%%     <<"my template">>
%% then the provided string is used as the template; however,
%% if the template is provided as a string/list:
%%     "my template"
%% then it is considered a path to a file whoes contents
%% is the template.  If the path does not start with
%% "/" then it is considered relative to this file.

%% ============================================================================
%% The databag mapping is used to match the role value returned by the GUI
%% to the name used in chef.  When we build a databag we look at all the
%% active (non-deleted) servers in an account and distribute the
%% hostname and IP according to matches in this list. 
%% IE:
%% If your mapping contained -> {<<"role_1">>, <<"freeswitch">>}
%% all servers in the account with "role_1" would be listed under
%% the "freeswitch" object in generated databags.
