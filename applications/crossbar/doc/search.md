### Search

#### About Search

The Search API allows query a value on databases. You can query different type of entity commonly like accounts (on `accounts` database), users, devices, callflows, numbers. It possible to search for any document base on it's ID.

Generally you have to provide which document type to search, which field in the document should be searched and a value to search with. How to specify these query parameters is depend on you want to search with a single value or multiple values.

##### Databases To Search On, Fields To Search With

Search for accounts is done on `accounts` database. The parameters that you can search with are:

* `name`: Account's name
* `realm`: Account's realm
* `id`: Account's ID

For other type of documents search is done on Account's database. The parameters to search with are:

* `name`: `name` field of the document if it has one or the ID of the document
* `name_and_number`: search either by `name` field or by `numbers`
* `number`: search by `numbers` field, usually used to search callflow.

##### Document Types

You have to specify what kind of piece of information is you're looking for (`t` query string parameter). Typically you're interested to search for an account.

Frequent types are:

* `account`
* `callflow`
* `device`
* `directory`
* `faxbox`
* `limits`
* `media`
* `menu`
* `user`
* `vmbox`

##### Create Custom Search Views (Advanced)

Search in Kazoo is possible with specific CouchDB view with design document ID `search` in account's database and `accounts` database. View index defined in this design document are exposing the common fields (`name`, `id`, etc...) in documents for search.

With that in mind, a system administrator can create a custom index to expose extra fields out of document to view. This requires full understanding of how to write CouchDB design documents and a bit of the internal structure of the document in the database. You can look at `{ACCOUNT_DB}/_design/search` to see how Kazoo default search view is implemented.

It's require to name your custom search view index name prefixed with `search_by_{YOUR_CUSTOME_VIEW_NAME}`, which conventionally `{YOUR_CUSTOME_VIEW_NAME}` is the name of the field in the document that you're creating this view for.
