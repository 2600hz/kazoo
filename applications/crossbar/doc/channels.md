The Channels API allows queries to find active channels for an account, a user, or a device. Given a call-id for a channel, a limited set of commands are allowed to be executed against that channel (such as hangup, transfer, or play media).

### _GET_ - Fetch User/Device channels

        curl -v -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" 'http://localhost:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/users/{USER_ID}/channels'

* Device

        curl -v -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" 'http://localhost:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/devices/{DEVICE_ID}/channels'


### _GET_ - Channel Details

        curl -v -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" 'http://localhost:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/channels/{UUID}'

### _POST_ - Execute an application against a Channel

     curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" 'http://localhost:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/channels/{CALL_ID} -d '{"data": {"action": "transfer", "target": "2600", "takeback_dtmf": "*1", "moh": "media_id" }}'

* `action`: What to do to the channel
  * `transfer`: Transfers the `{CALL_ID}` leg to the `target` extension/DID and places the other leg on hold
  * `hangup`: Hangup the `{CALL_ID}` leg
* All other arguments are determined by the `action` value
