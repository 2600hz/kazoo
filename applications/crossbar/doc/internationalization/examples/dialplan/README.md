Instead of providing examples for all Europe, which is almost imposible
i created these rules for NL with a specific rule for Rotterdam, they are an easy to understand example of what u can do with 
the Kazoo dialplan in your account, device or user doc. or easy... it took me some time ))

These dial plans may interfere with your extensions, so its adviced to maintain a certain structure in 
those and create a regex in the GUI to prevent users from creating valid DIDs as extensionnumbers.
(if thats posible)

Please feel free to add your own rules here if u have them!
If u cant use github u can email them to info@yumminova.eu and ill see to it.

Because of the complexity of the formats of numbers in EU it may be hard to create a set of rules that always work.
Keep that in mind
