Hi James

Robert here from Yumminova

Imnew to git so i have noclue yet what to do so bare with me.

One way to make Kazoo international is to enable accounts to specify what country they are in, what region and what city.
That way we could make rules to make it work, instead of using different clusters for 
different countryÂ´s and then dealing with clients that have international numbers.

So .. im baking some rules and can do so for all countries if needed.
Would u think that if i cook up a rule to reconsile all numbers, also convert them into E.164 when needed 
we could use one cluster by setting multiple classifiers in number manager?
