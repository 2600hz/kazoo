Kazoo provides many prompts, such as during voicemail, to instruct callers on things to do. The default prompts that ship with Kazoo are provided in English, but as is often the case, supporting callers who don't speak English requires alternative language prompts.

Similar to i18n efforts on the front end, Kazoo is now configurable to provide these system prompts in alternative languages. The language is selected from one of several places:

* The account processing the call
* Manually set during a callflow
* The default system language
