# 402 Payment Required

When a request is made via API and this request is updating a quantity from the services (e.g. adding a device, a user, a number, etc...) API will return a `402 Payment Required` error message to show resulting charge for preforming the query.

For accepting the charge and performing the query, you have to send the same exact request payload again this time with `accept_charges: true` in root body of the payload.

## Example Accept Charges Response

For example if make a request to add Numbers UI application to the account, if performing this request requires accept charge base on your service plan API will return this response:

!!! note
    `"activation_charges"` is the total for all category / items.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "{CATEGORY}": {
            "{ITEM}": {
                "category": "{CATEGORY}",
                "item": "{ITEM}",
                "quantity": 1,
                "rate": 2.0,
                "single_discount": true,
                "single_discount_rate": 0.0,
                "cumulative_discount": 0,
                "cumulative_discount_rate": 0.0,
                "activation_charges": 1.0
            }
        },
        "activation_charges": 1.0
    },
    "error": "402",
    "message": "accept charges",
    "status": "error"
}
```

For accepting the charge simply repeat the first request with `accept_charges: true` included.

```json
{
    "data": {...},
    "accept_charges": true,
    "auth_token": "{AUTH_TOKEN}"
}
```
