A blacklist is a map of caller id numbers that can be then apply to the account to block these callers to call the system.

#### Structure

The structure is really simple:

* `name`: A freindly name for your blacklist.
* `numbers`: A map of caller id to block

Ex:

```json
{
    "name": "Main Blacklist",
    "numbers": {
        "+14151234567": {
        }
    }
}
```

When you upload numbers they will be converted to e164 format.

#### Usage

Once you created your blacklists using the api you can apply them to the account by adding the blacklist ids to the account, like the following:

```json
"blacklists": [
    "dbfc14854a06bab3014898b6b4e1ffa0", // Main blacklist
    "davb14854a06bab3542132b6b4e1ffa0"  // Secondary blacklist
]
```

#### Crossbar

Using Crossbar to modify Blacklist is very simple:

* GET - Gets the current set(s).
* PUT - Add a set.
* POST - Updates a set.
* DELETE - Removes a set.
