# Faxes

## Fax Subsystem Overview

The Faxes API exposes lots of ways to send, receive, track and manage faxes.

As a general concept, faxes are either considered inbound or outbound faxes. In addition:

* API calls with the term "incoming" are used for tracking faxes currently in the process of being received
* API calls with the term "inbox" are used for managing faxes which have already been received
* API calls with the term "outgoing" are used for tracking faxes currently in the process of being sent
* API calls with the term "outbox" are used for managing faxes which have already been sent

#### Schema

Faxes API allows you to update and access fax jobs for both sending and receiving

## Send Outgoing Fax

There are two way to send outgoing fax. You can provide a URL to the document you wish or send or you can provide the the document with the same send request payload.

> PUT /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes

```shell
curl -v -X PUT \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    -d '{"data":{"document":{"url":"http://myserver.com/fax.pdf","method":"get"},"retries":3,"from_name":"Test Fax","from_number":"18884732963","to_name":"To Name","to_number":"18884732963"}}' \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes
```

```json
{
    "data":{
        "document":{
            "url":"http://myserver.com/fax.pdf",
            "method":"get"
        },
        "retries":3,
        "from_name":"Test Fax",
        "from_number":"18884732963",
        "to_name":"To Name",
        "to_number":"18884732963",
        "attempts":0,
        "tx_result":{
            "error_message":"",
            "fax_bad_rows":0,
            "fax_error_correction":false,
            "fax_receiver_id":""
            ,"fax_speed":0,
            "pages_sent":0,
            "success":false,
            "time_elapsed":0
        },
        "fax_timezone":"undefined",
        "id":"{FAX_JOB_ID}"
    },
    "revision":"{REVISION}",
    "request_id":"{REQUEST_ID}",
    "status":"success",
    "auth_token":"{AUTH_TOKEN}"
}
```

In the second method, you can use a single PUT request and send a [multi-part `content-type`](./multipart) to attach both the JSON metadata about the fax transmission and the document itself, in a single request. This avoids needing to have an external storage location for storing fax attachments prior to processing. This is a good solution for portals that upload documents.

```shell
curl -v -X PUT \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/mixed" \
     -F "content=@fax.json; type=application/json" \
     -F "content=@fax.pdf; type=application/pdf" \
     -H 'X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}' \
     http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes
```

## Create an outgoing fax (Alias)

This is identical to the `PUT /faxes` above.

> PUT /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outgoing

```shell
curl -v -X PUT \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outgoing
```

## Fetch outgoing faxes and their statuses

This API retrieves a listing of all outgoing faxes. Use the "id" to fetch details about a particular job. Results will contain a listing of both API- and SMTP (email) - initiated outbound faxes.

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outgoing

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outgoing
```

```json
{
    "auth_token": "{AUTH_TOKEN}",
    "data": [
        {
            "created": 63626410973,
            "from": "18884732963",
            "id": "{FAX_JOB_ID}",
            "status": "pending",
            "to": "18884732963"
        }
    ],
    "page_size": 1,
    "request_id": "{REQUEST_ID}",
    "revision": "{REVISION}",
    "start_key": [
        "{START_KEY}"
    ],
    "status": "success"
}
```

## Fetch details of a queued outgoing fax job

Get all the details about a fax that is in the outgoing queue.

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outgoing/{FAX_JOB_ID}

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outgoing/{FAX_JOB_ID}
```

```json
{
    "auth_token": "{AUTH_TOKEN}",
    "data": {
        "attempts": 0,
        "created": 63626410973,
        "delivered": "undefined",
        "document": {
            "method": "get",
            "url": "http://myserver.com/fax.pdf"
        },
        "fax_timezone": "undefined",
        "from_name": "Test Fax",
        "from_number": "18884732963",
        "id": "{FAX_JOB_ID}",
        "retries": 3,
        "status": "pending",
        "to_name": "To Name",
        "to_number": "18884732963",
        "tx_result": {
            "error_message": "",
            "fax_bad_rows": 0,
            "fax_error_correction": false,
            "fax_receiver_id": "",
            "fax_speed": 0,
            "pages_sent": 0,
            "success": false,
            "time_elapsed": 0
        }
    },
    "request_id": "{REQUEST_ID}",
    "revision": "{REVISION}",
    "status": "success"
}
```

## Managing Past Outbound Faxes

### Fetch All Previously Sent Faxes In The Outbox Folder

This API retrieves a listing of all outgoing faxes which have already been sent or attempted and are no longer in queue. Results will contain a listing of both API- and SMTP (email) - initiated outbound faxes.

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox
```

### Fetch A Fax From The Outbox Folder

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}
```

### Resubmit A Fax From The Outbox Folder

> PUT /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}

```shell
curl -v -X PUT \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    -d '{"action": "resubmit", "data": {}}'
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}
```

### Fetch The Fax Payload

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}/attachment

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}/attachment
```


### Fetch Logs Related To Outbound Faxes Submitted Via Email

If a fax job was queued or attempted to be queued as the result of an inbound email, the SMTP log for that fax can be retrieved via this API. This is also useful for helping debug problems with inbound faxes, such as when the domain matched an account for an inbound fax, but not a specific faxbox, and thus failed to process.

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/smtplog

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/smtplog
```

### Fetch A Specific Log Related To Email

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/smtplog/{ATTEMPT_ID}

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/smtplog/{ATTEMPT_ID}
```


### Remove A Fax From The Outbox Folder

This API allows you to delete an old fax message. For privacy reasons, this may be useful if you wish to remove all evidence of a previously sent outbound fax.

> DELETE /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}

```shell
curl -v -X DELETE \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}
```

### Remove The Fax Payload

In some cases, you may wish to remove the document from a fax (usually for privacy reasons) but keep evidence that the fax transmission occurred. This will remove attachments but not the metadata from a sent fax.


> DELETE /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}/attachment

```shell
curl -v -X DELETE \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/outbox/{FAX_ID}/attachment
```

## Managing Past Inbound Faxes

### Fetch All Faxes In The Inbox Folder

Retrieve a list of faxes that have previously been received.

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox
```

### Fetch A Fax From The Inbox Folder

Retrieve all metadata about a particular fax for which you have the fax ID.

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox/{FAX_ID}

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox/{FAX_ID}
```

### Fetch The Fax Payload

Retrieve the fax document / attachments for a particular inbound fax for which you have the fax ID.

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox/{FAX_ID}/attachment

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox/{FAX_ID}/attachment
```

### Remove A Fax From The Inbox Folder

Delete an old fax message. For privacy reasons, this may be useful if you wish to remove all evidence of a previously received inbound fax.

> DELETE /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox/{FAX_ID}

```shell
curl -v -X DELETE \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox/{FAX_ID}
```

### Remove The Fax Payload

In some cases, you may wish to remove the document from a fax (usually for privacy reasons) but keep evidence that the fax receipt occurred. This will remove attachments but not the metadata from a received fax. Useful after you've done post-processing on a fax externally.

> DELETE /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox/{FAX_ID}/attachment

```shell
curl -v -X DELETE \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/faxes/inbox/{FAX_ID}/attachment
```
