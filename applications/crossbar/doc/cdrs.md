## Fetch all legs related to an interaction

Crossbar cdrs was extended to provide simplified interaction call detail records. It groups all CDRs that interacted with each other to form a list of calls.

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/cdrs/legs/{INTERACTION_ID}

```shell
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/cdrs/legs/{INTERACTION_ID}
```

## Variations

You can select CDRs/interactions for a specific user by adding them to the URI:

> GET /v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/users/{USER_ID}/cdrs

## Notes on fields

Some fields need a little more explanation to help you understand what they are telling you about the call leg.

* `call_direction` - direction of the leg, relative to the media switch
  * `inbound` - leg came into the media switch (typically the A-leg)
  * `outbound` - leg started on the media switch (typically the B-leg)
* `hangup_cause` - The reason why the call leg ended. See the [FreeSWITCH Hangup Causes](http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Hangup_causes) page for descriptions.
* `billing_seconds` - How many seconds of the call are billable (post answer, normally)
* `to` - Depends on the direction of the leg
  * outbound - Uses the presence-id or else it uses the SIP Request address
  * inbound - the SIP To header

### Kazoo-specific properties

These are properties set by Kazoo for internal purposes. These are the properties found under the `custom_channel_vars` property at the top-level of the CDR JSON object. The non-exhaustive list of properties:

* `account_id` - Account ID this leg belongs to
* `authorizing_id` - Document ID used to authorize this call leg
* `authorizing_type` - Type of document used to authorize call
  * `device` - the call leg is to/from a known Kazoo device
  * `mobile` - the call leg is to/from a known Kazoo mobile device
  * `resource` - the call leg is from a known offnet carrier
  * `outbound_fax`
* `bridge_id` - Typically the A-leg's call-id; helps with tracking transfers
* `ecallmgr_node` - Which ecallmgr node is processing the call leg
* `fetch_id` - The dialplan XML fetch ID from FreeSWITCH
* `realm` - the SIP realm of the account
* `resource_id` - Resource ID used for the leg; typically a carrier, local or global, that the call was routed to
* `username` - the SIP username of the endpoint that started the leg

### Billing-related Properties

These properties relate to how the leg was rated and billed. Some of these properties are not accessible via Crossbar, but may exist on the CDR

* `reseller_billing` - tag describing what billing was used for the reseller
* `reseller_id` - Account ID of the reseller for the account of this leg
* `account_billing` - tag describing what billing was used for the account
* `rate` - Rate of the call
* `base_cost` - How much the call costs to start (if per-minute)
* `rate_name` - Name of the rate doc used
* `surcharge` - Surcharge added to the leg
* `rate_minimum` - Minimum number of seconds to bill for
* `rate_increment` - Increment of seconds to bill for

### Fax-specific Properties

These properties may exist on a CDR for a fax request (inbound or outbound):

* `fax_transfer_rate` - Baud of the fax transfer
* `fax_bad_rows` - Number of rows that failed to transfer
* `fax_total_pages` - Number of pages in the fax (see `fax_transferred_pages` for how many made it)
* `fax_transferred_pages` - Number of pages transferred
* `fax_ecm_used` - Was ECM (error correction mode) used on the fax
* `fax_result_text` - Error String, if any, or 'OK' if successful
* `fax_result_code` - [Result code](http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Variable_fax_result_code) of the transmission
* `fax_success` - boolean for whether the fax was considered a success
* `fax_t38` - boolean for whether the fax T.38 was used

### Resource Properties

All resource properties are set by the Stepswitch application.

* `resource_type` - This property attempts to explain the reason the resource was used.  The possible values are:
    * offnet-origination - Inbound call from a resource/carrier to a Kazoo account
    * offnet-termination - Outbound call from a Kazoo account to a resource/carrier
    * onnet-origination - Inbound call from a Kazoo account to another Kazoo account
    * onnet-termination - Outbound call from a Kazoo account to another Kazoo account
* `global_resource` - This boolean is TRUE when the channel has been created by processing a resource from the offnet database, and FALSE if the resource is from an account database (local).
* `resource_id` - This is resource document id used to create the channel
