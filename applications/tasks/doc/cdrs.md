# CDR Task

Accounts with large volumes of CDRs find the API insufficient for downloading a month's worth of CDRs for billing purposes. This task aims to allow folks to have their CDR CSV created in the background and retrievable once finished as a task versus having to hope their dataset can be processed before the API timeout occurs.

## Available Tasks

### Dump

Dumps the current month's CDRs to a CSV file.
