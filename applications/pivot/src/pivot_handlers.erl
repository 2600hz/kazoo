    %% 2) by convention b_function is the blocking version of the function.
    %% so, play/2 would send the play command and immediate continue to the hangup below.
    %% instead, we prefer to wait until the media is done playing before continuing,
    %% so we call b_play to block us until the media is finished.
    %% 3) we explicity match {ok, Call1} to indicate the playing finished without error;
    %% if we wanted to handle when unexpected things happen (like when the caller hangs up
    %% while the audio is still playing, we would use a case and match for
    %% {error, hungup, Call2} and do cleanup of some kind.

    %% otherwise (why send a hangup to a call that's hungup).
