%% Guaranteed Multicast
%% ====================
%%
%% This module provides the ability to create named groups of
%% processes to which members can be dynamically added and removed,
%% and for messages to be broadcast within the group that are
%% guaranteed to reach all members of the group during the lifetime of
%% the message. The lifetime of a message is defined as being, at a
%% minimum, the time from which the message is first sent to any
%% member of the group, up until the time at which it is known by the
%% member who published the message that the message has reached all
%% group members.
%%
%% The guarantee given is that provided a message, once sent, makes it
%% to members who do not all leave the group, the message will
%% continue to propagate to all group members.
%%
%% Another way of stating the guarantee is that if member P publishes
%% messages m and m', then for all members P', if P' is a member of
%% the group prior to the publication of m, and P' receives m', then
%% P' will receive m.
%%
%% Note that only local-ordering is enforced: i.e. if member P sends
%% message m and then message m', then for-all members P', if P'
%% receives m and m', then they will receive m' after m. Causality
%% ordering is _not_ enforced. I.e. if member P receives message m
%% and as a result publishes message m', there is no guarantee that
%% other members P' will receive m before m'.
%%
%%
%% API Use
%% -------
%%
%% Mnesia must be started. Use the idempotent create_tables/0 function
%% to create the tables required.
%%
%% start_link/3
%% Provide the group name, the callback module name, and any arguments
%% you wish to be passed into the callback module's functions. The
%% joined/2 function will be called when we have joined the group,
%% with the arguments passed to start_link and a list of the current
%% members of the group. See the callbacks specs and the comments
%% below for further details of the callback functions.
%%
%% leave/1
%% Provide the Pid. Removes the Pid from the group. The callback
%% handle_terminate/2 function will be called.
%%
%% broadcast/2
%% Provide the Pid and a Message. The message will be sent to all
%% members of the group as per the guarantees given above. This is a
%% cast and the function call will return immediately. There is no
%% guarantee that the message will reach any member of the group.
%%
%% confirmed_broadcast/2
%% Provide the Pid and a Message. As per broadcast/2 except that this
%% is a call, not a cast, and only returns 'ok' once the Message has
%% reached every member of the group. Do not call
%% confirmed_broadcast/2 directly from the callback module otherwise
%% you will deadlock the entire group.
%%
%% info/1
%% Provide the Pid. Returns a proplist with various facts, including
%% the group name and the current group members.
%%
%% validate_members/2
%% Check whether a given member list agrees with the chosen member's
%% view. Any differences will be communicated via the members_changed
%% callback. If there are no differences then there will be no reply.
%% Note that members will not necessarily share the same view.
%%
%% forget_group/1
%% Provide the group name. Removes its mnesia record. Makes no attempt
%% to ensure the group is empty.
%%
%% Implementation Overview
%% -----------------------
%%
%% One possible means of implementation would be a fan-out from the
%% sender to every member of the group. This would require that the
%% group is fully connected, and, in the event that the original
%% sender of the message disappears from the group before the message
%% has made it to every member of the group, raises questions as to
%% who is responsible for sending on the message to new group members.
%% In particular, the issue is with [ Pid ! Msg || Pid <- Members ] -
%% if the sender dies part way through, who is responsible for
%% ensuring that the remaining Members receive the Msg? In the event
%% that within the group, messages sent are broadcast from a subset of
%% the members, the fan-out arrangement has the potential to
%% substantially impact the CPU and network workload of such members,
%% as such members would have to accommodate the cost of sending each
%% message to every group member.
%%
%% Instead, if the members of the group are arranged in a chain, then
%% it becomes easier to reason about who within the group has received
%% each message and who has not. It eases issues of responsibility: in
%% the event of a group member disappearing, the nearest upstream
%% member of the chain is responsible for ensuring that messages
%% continue to propagate down the chain. It also results in equal
%% distribution of sending and receiving workload, even if all
%% messages are being sent from just a single group member. This
%% configuration has the further advantage that it is not necessary
%% for every group member to know of every other group member, and
%% even that a group member does not have to be accessible from all
%% other group members.
%%
%% Performance is kept high by permitting pipelining and all
%% communication between joined group members is asynchronous. In the
%% chain A -> B -> C -> D, if A sends a message to the group, it will
%% not directly contact C or D. However, it must know that D receives
%% the message (in addition to B and C) before it can consider the
%% message fully sent. A simplistic implementation would require that
%% D replies to C, C replies to B and B then replies to A. This would
%% result in a propagation delay of twice the length of the chain. It
%% would also require, in the event of the failure of C, that D knows
%% to directly contact B and issue the necessary replies. Instead, the
%% chain forms a ring: D sends the message on to A: D does not
%% distinguish A as the sender, merely as the next member (downstream)
%% within the chain (which has now become a ring). When A receives
%% from D messages that A sent, it knows that all members have
%% received the message. However, the message is not dead yet: if C
%% died as B was sending to C, then B would need to detect the death
%% of C and forward the message on to D instead: thus every node has
%% to remember every message published until it is told that it can
%% forget about the message. This is essential not just for dealing
%% with failure of members, but also for the addition of new members.
%%
%% Thus once A receives the message back again, it then sends to B an
%% acknowledgement for the message, indicating that B can now forget
%% about the message. B does so, and forwards the ack to C. C forgets
%% the message, and forwards the ack to D, which forgets the message
%% and finally forwards the ack back to A. At this point, A takes no
%% further action: the message and its acknowledgement have made it to
%% every member of the group. The message is now dead, and any new
%% member joining the group at this point will not receive the
%% message.
%%
%% We therefore have two roles:
%%
%% 1. The sender, who upon receiving their own messages back, must
%% then send out acknowledgements, and upon receiving their own
%% acknowledgements back perform no further action.
%%
%% 2. The other group members who upon receiving messages and
%% acknowledgements must update their own internal state accordingly
%% (the sending member must also do this in order to be able to
%% accommodate failures), and forwards messages on to their downstream
%% neighbours.
%%
%%
%% Implementation: It gets trickier
%% --------------------------------
%%
%% Chain A -> B -> C -> D
%%
%% A publishes a message which B receives. A now dies. B and D will
%% detect the death of A, and will link up, thus the chain is now B ->
%% C -> D. B forwards A's message on to C, who forwards it to D, who
%% forwards it to B. Thus B is now responsible for A's messages - both
%% publications and acknowledgements that were in flight at the point
%% at which A died. Even worse is that this is transitive: after B
%% forwards A's message to C, B dies as well. Now C is not only
%% responsible for B's in-flight messages, but is also responsible for
%% A's in-flight messages.
%%
%% Lemma 1: A member can only determine which dead members they have
%% inherited responsibility for if there is a total ordering on the
%% conflicting additions and subtractions of members from the group.
%%
%% Consider the simultaneous death of B and addition of B' that
%% transitions a chain from A -> B -> C to A -> B' -> C. Either B' or
%% C is responsible for in-flight messages from B. It is easy to
%% ensure that at least one of them thinks they have inherited B, but
%% if we do not ensure that exactly one of them inherits B, then we
%% could have B' converting publishes to acks, which then will crash C
%% as C does not believe it has issued acks for those messages.
%%
%% More complex scenarios are easy to concoct: A -> B -> C -> D -> E
%% becoming A -> C' -> E. Who has inherited which of B, C and D?
%%
%% However, for non-conflicting membership changes, only a partial
%% ordering is required. For example, A -> B -> C becoming A -> A' ->
%% B. The addition of A', between A and B can have no conflicts with
%% the death of C: it is clear that A has inherited C's messages.
%%
%% For ease of implementation, we adopt the simple solution, of
%% imposing a total order on all membership changes.
%%
%% On the death of a member, it is ensured the dead member's
%% neighbours become aware of the death, and the upstream neighbour
%% now sends to its new downstream neighbour its state, including the
%% messages pending acknowledgement. The downstream neighbour can then
%% use this to calculate which publishes and acknowledgements it has
%% missed out on, due to the death of its old upstream. Thus the
%% downstream can catch up, and continues the propagation of messages
%% through the group.
%%
%% Lemma 2: When a member is joining, it must synchronously
%% communicate with its upstream member in order to receive its
%% starting state atomically with its addition to the group.
%%
%% New members must start with the same state as their nearest
%% upstream neighbour. This ensures that it is not surprised by
%% acknowledgements they are sent, and that should their downstream
%% neighbour die, they are able to send the correct state to their new
%% downstream neighbour to ensure it can catch up. Thus in the
%% transition A -> B -> C becomes A -> A' -> B -> C becomes A -> A' ->
%% C, A' must start with the state of A, so that it can send C the
%% correct state when B dies, allowing C to detect any missed
%% messages.
%%
%% If A' starts by adding itself to the group membership, A could then
%% die, without A' having received the necessary state from A. This
%% would leave A' responsible for in-flight messages from A, but
%% having the least knowledge of all, of those messages. Thus A' must
%% start by synchronously calling A, which then immediately sends A'
%% back its state. A then adds A' to the group. If A dies at this
%% point then A' will be able to see this (as A' will fail to appear
%% in the group membership), and thus A' will ignore the state it
%% receives from A, and will simply repeat the process, trying to now
%% join downstream from some other member. This ensures that should
%% the upstream die as soon as the new member has been joined, the new
%% member is guaranteed to receive the correct state, allowing it to
%% correctly process messages inherited due to the death of its
%% upstream neighbour.
%%
%% The canonical definition of the group membership is held by a
%% distributed database. Whilst this allows the total ordering of
%% changes to be achieved, it is nevertheless undesirable to have to
%% query this database for the current view, upon receiving each
%% message. Instead, we wish for members to be able to cache a view of
%% the group membership, which then requires a cache invalidation
%% mechanism. Each member maintains its own view of the group
%% membership. Thus when the group's membership changes, members may
%% need to become aware of such changes in order to be able to
%% accurately process messages they receive. Because of the
%% requirement of a total ordering of conflicting membership changes,
%% it is not possible to use the guaranteed broadcast mechanism to
%% communicate these changes: to achieve the necessary ordering, it
%% would be necessary for such messages to be published by exactly one
%% member, which can not be guaranteed given that such a member could
%% die.
%%
%% The total ordering we enforce on membership changes gives rise to a
%% view version number: every change to the membership creates a
%% different view, and the total ordering permits a simple
%% monotonically increasing view version number.
%%
%% Lemma 3: If a message is sent from a member that holds view version
%% N, it can be correctly processed by any member receiving the
%% message with a view version >= N.
%%
%% Initially, let us suppose that each view contains the ordering of
%% every member that was ever part of the group. Dead members are
%% marked as such. Thus we have a ring of members, some of which are
%% dead, and are thus inherited by the nearest alive downstream
%% member.
%%
%% In the chain A -> B -> C, all three members initially have view
%% version 1, which reflects reality. B publishes a message, which is
%% forward by C to A. B now dies, which A notices very quickly. Thus A
%% updates the view, creating version 2. It now forwards B's
%% publication, sending that message to its new downstream neighbour,
%% C. This happens before C is aware of the death of B. C must become
%% aware of the view change before it interprets the message its
%% received, otherwise it will fail to learn of the death of B, and
%% thus will not realise it has inherited B's messages (and will
%% likely crash).
%%
%% Thus very simply, we have that each subsequent view contains more
%% information than the preceding view.
%%
%% However, to avoid the views growing indefinitely, we need to be
%% able to delete members which have died _and_ for which no messages
%% are in-flight. This requires that upon inheriting a dead member, we
%% know the last publication sent by the dead member (this is easy: we
%% inherit a member because we are the nearest downstream member which
%% implies that we know at least as much than everyone else about the
%% publications of the dead member), and we know the earliest message
%% for which the acknowledgement is still in flight.
%%
%% In the chain A -> B -> C, when B dies, A will send to C its state
%% (as C is the new downstream from A), allowing C to calculate which
%% messages it has missed out on (described above). At this point, C
%% also inherits B's messages. If that state from A also includes the
%% last message published by B for which an acknowledgement has been
%% seen, then C knows exactly which further acknowledgements it must
%% receive (also including issuing acknowledgements for publications
%% still in-flight that it receives), after which it is known there
%% are no more messages in flight for B, thus all evidence that B was
%% ever part of the group can be safely removed from the canonical
%% group membership.
%%
%% Thus, for every message that a member sends, it includes with that
%% message its view version. When a member receives a message it will
%% update its view from the canonical copy, should its view be older
%% than the view version included in the message it has received.
%%
%% The state held by each member therefore includes the messages from
%% each publisher pending acknowledgement, the last publication seen
%% from that publisher, and the last acknowledgement from that
%% publisher. In the case of the member's own publications or
%% inherited members, this last acknowledgement seen state indicates
%% the last acknowledgement retired, rather than sent.
%%
%%
%% Proof sketch
%% ------------
%%
%% We need to prove that with the provided operational semantics, we
%% can never reach a state that is not well formed from a well-formed
%% starting state.
%%
%% Operational semantics (small step): straight-forward message
%% sending, process monitoring, state updates.
%%
%% Well formed state: dead members inherited by exactly one non-dead
%% member; for every entry in anyone's pending-acks, either (the
%% publication of the message is in-flight downstream from the member
%% and upstream from the publisher) or (the acknowledgement of the
%% message is in-flight downstream from the publisher and upstream
%% from the member).
%%
%% Proof by induction on the applicable operational semantics.
%%
%%
%% Related work
%% ------------
%%
%% The ring configuration and double traversal of messages around the
%% ring is similar (though developed independently) to the LCR
%% protocol by [Levy 2008]. However, LCR differs in several
%% ways. Firstly, by using vector clocks, it enforces a total order of
%% message delivery, which is unnecessary for our purposes. More
%% significantly, it is built on top of a "group communication system"
%% which performs the group management functions, taking
%% responsibility away from the protocol as to how to cope with safely
%% adding and removing members. When membership changes do occur, the
%% protocol stipulates that every member must perform communication
%% with every other member of the group, to ensure all outstanding
%% deliveries complete, before the entire group transitions to the new
%% view. This, in total, requires two sets of all-to-all synchronous
%% communications.
%%
%% This is not only rather inefficient, but also does not explain what
%% happens upon the failure of a member during this process. It does
%% though entirely avoid the need for inheritance of responsibility of
%% dead members that our protocol incorporates.
%%
%% In [Marandi et al 2010], a Paxos-based protocol is described. This
%% work explicitly focuses on the efficiency of communication. LCR
%% (and our protocol too) are more efficient, but at the cost of
%% higher latency. The Ring-Paxos protocol is itself built on top of
%% IP-multicast, which rules it out for many applications where
%% point-to-point communication is all that can be required. They also
%% have an excellent related work section which I really ought to
%% read...

%% The Erlang distribution mechanism has an interesting quirk - it
%% will kill the VM cold with "Absurdly large distribution output data
%% buffer" if you attempt to send a message which serialises out to
%% more than 2^31 bytes in size. It's therefore a very good idea to
%% make sure that we don't exceed that size!
%%
%% Now, we could figure out the size of messages as they come in using
%% size(term_to_binary(Msg)) or similar. The trouble is, that requires
%% us to serialise the message only to throw the serialised form
%% away. Hard to believe that's a sensible thing to do. So instead we
%% accept a size hint from the application, via broadcast/3. This size
%% hint can be the size of anything in the message which we expect
%% could be large, and we just ignore the size of any small bits of
%% the message term. Therefore MAX_BUFFER_SIZE is set somewhat
%% conservatively at 100MB - but the buffer is only to allow us to
%% buffer tiny messages anyway, so 100MB is plenty.
