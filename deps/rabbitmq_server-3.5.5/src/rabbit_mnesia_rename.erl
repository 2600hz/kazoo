%% Supports renaming the nodes in the Mnesia database. In order to do
%% this, we take a backup of the database, traverse the backup
%% changing node names and pids as we go, then restore it.
%%
%% That's enough for a standalone node, for clusters the story is more
%% complex. We can take pairs of nodes From and To, but backing up and
%% restoring the database changes schema cookies, so if we just do
%% this on all nodes the cluster will refuse to re-form with
%% "Incompatible schema cookies.". Therefore we do something similar
%% to what we do for upgrades - the first node in the cluster to
%% restart becomes the authority, and other nodes wipe their own
%% Mnesia state and rejoin. They also need to tell Mnesia the old node
%% is not coming back.
%%
%% If we are renaming nodes one at a time then the running cluster
%% might not be aware that a rename has taken place, so after we wipe
%% and rejoin we then update any tables (in practice just
%% rabbit_durable_queue) which should be aware that we have changed.
