<h1>Cluster name: <b><%= fmt_string(cluster_name.name) %></b></h1>

<p>
  The cluster name can be used by clients to identify clusters over
  AMQP connections, and is used by the shovel and federation plugins
  to identify which clusters a message has been routed through.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the cluster name is announced to clients in the AMQP
  server properties; i.e. before authentication has taken
  place. Therefore it should not be considered secret.
</p>
<p>
  The cluster name is generated by default from the name of the first
  node in the cluster, but can be changed.
