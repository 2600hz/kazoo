This is a very simple example, designed to be set up with the modern
Debian / Ubuntu packaging of OpenLDAP. Running setup.sh after "apt-get
install slapd" will wipe out any existing LDAP database and get you:

* A domain
* An admin user
* A couple of normal users
* A group containing the users
* An OU representing a vhost

These correspond to the examples mentioned in the documentation.
