Requirements
============

You can build and install it like any other plugin (see
http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html).

Documentation
=============

See http://www.rabbitmq.com/ldap.html

Limitations
===========

Currently this plugin is rather chatty with LDAP connections when
doing authorisation over LDAP - every time RabbitMQ needs to do an
authorisation query it starts a new LDAP connection. However, RabbitMQ
does have a per-channel authorisation cache, so this is not too awful.

There might need to be more types of queries.
