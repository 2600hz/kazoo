Cookie example
==============

To try this example, you need GNU `make` and `git` in your PATH.

To build the example, run the following command:

``` bash
$ make
```

To start the release in the foreground:

``` bash
$ ./_rel/bin/cookie_example console
```

Then point your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
This example allows you to use any path to show that the cookies
are defined site-wide. Try it!
