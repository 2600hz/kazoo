%% @doc Behaviour for long-lived HTTP handlers.
%%
%% <em>init/3</em> allows you to initialize a state for all subsequent
%% callbacks, and indicate to Cowboy whether you accept to handle the
%% request or want to shutdown without handling it, in which case the
%% receive loop and <em>info/3</em> calls will simply be skipped.
%%
%% <em>info/3</em> allows you to handle the messages this process will
%% receive. It receives the message and the state previously defined.
%% It can decide to stop the receive loop or continue receiving.
%%
%% <em>terminate/3</em> allows you to clean up. It receives the
%% termination reason and the state previously defined.
%%
%% There is no required operation to perform in any of these callbacks
%% other than returning the proper values. Make sure you always return
%% the last modified Req so that Cowboy has the up to date information
%% about the request.
%%
%% It is recommended to use hibernate if this process is not going to
%% receive a lot of messages. It is also recommended to use a timeout
%% value so that the connection gets closed after a long period of
%% inactivity.
