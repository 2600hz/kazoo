%% @doc Behaviour for short-lived HTTP handlers.
%%
%% <em>init/3</em> allows you to initialize a state for all subsequent
%% callbacks, and indicate to Cowboy whether you accept to handle the
%% request or want to shutdown without handling it, in which case the
%% <em>handle/2</em> call will simply be skipped.
%%
%% <em>handle/2</em> allows you to handle the request. It receives the
%% state previously defined.
%%
%% <em>terminate/3</em> allows you to clean up. It receives the
%% termination reason and the state previously defined.
%%
%% There is no required operation to perform in any of these callbacks
%% other than returning the proper values. Make sure you always return
%% the last modified Req so that Cowboy has the up to date information
%% about the request.
