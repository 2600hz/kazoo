%% @doc Behaviour for middlewares.
%%
%% Only one function needs to be implemented, <em>execute/2</em>.
%% It receives the Req and the environment and returns them
%% optionally modified. It can decide to stop the processing with
%% or without an error. It is also possible to hibernate the process
%% if needed.
%%
%% A middleware can perform any operation. Make sure you always return
%% the last modified Req so that Cowboy has the up to date information
%% about the request.
