Cowlib
======

Cowlib is a support library for manipulating Web protocols.

Goals
-----

Cowlib provides libraries for parsing and building messages
for various Web protocols, including SPDY, HTTP and Websocket.

It is optimized for completeness rather than speed. No value
is ignored, they are all returned.
