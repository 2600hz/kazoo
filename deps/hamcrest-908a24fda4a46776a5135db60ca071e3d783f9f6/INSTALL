Installation

Hamcrest (Erlang) is probably best installed with a package manager like epm. 
If you're building from sources, you should be aware that you'll need to have
erlydtl installed because there are post compilation build scripts which are 
depending on this, and the rebar configuration doesn't cover erlydtl due to 
some odd interdependencies. 

Building with make is a simple matter of running `make compile` and then 
copying the relevant files to your Erlang code:lib_dir() or ERL_LIBS directory.

Installing via epm: `epm install hamcrest-erlang`
