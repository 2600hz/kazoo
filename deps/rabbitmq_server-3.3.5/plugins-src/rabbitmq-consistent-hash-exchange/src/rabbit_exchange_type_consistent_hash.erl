    %% to do a linear scan of the entries in the table that have the
    %% correct exchange name. More sophisticated solutions include,
    %% for example, having some sort of tree as the value of a single
    %% mnesia entry for each exchange. However, such values tend to
    %% end up as relatively deep data structures which cost a lot to
    %% continually copy to the process heap. Consequently, such
    %% approaches have not been found to be much faster, if at all.
