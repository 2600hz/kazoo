%% All of our actual server processes are supervised by
%% rabbit_federation_sup, which is started by a rabbit_boot_step
%% (since it needs to start up before queue / exchange recovery, so it
%% can't be part of our application).
%%
%% However, we still need an application behaviour since we need to
%% know when our application has started since then the Erlang client
%% will have started and we can therefore start our links going. Since
%% the application behaviour needs a tree of processes to supervise,
%% this is it...
