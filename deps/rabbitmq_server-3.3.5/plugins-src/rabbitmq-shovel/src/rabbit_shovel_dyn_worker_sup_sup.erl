%% [1] An autodeleting worker removes its own parameter, and thus ends
%% up here via the parameter callback. It is a transient worker that
%% is just about to terminate normally - so we don't need to tell the
%% supervisor to stop us - and as usual if we call into our own
%% supervisor we risk deadlock.
