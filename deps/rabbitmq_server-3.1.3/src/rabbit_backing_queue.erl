%% not depend on this function being called on shutdown and instead
%% should hook into the rabbit supervision hierarchy.

%% Initialise the backing queue and its state.
%%
%% Takes
%% 1. the amqqueue record
%% 2. a boolean indicating whether the queue is an existing queue that
%%    should be recovered
%% 3. an asynchronous callback which accepts a function of type
%%    backing-queue-state to backing-queue-state. This callback
%%    function can be safely invoked from any process, which makes it
%%    useful for passing messages back into the backing queue,
%%    especially as the backing queue does not have control of its own
%%    mailbox.

%% Called when the queue is terminating and needs to delete all its

%% Remove all 'fetchable' messages from the queue, i.e. all messages

%% Remove all messages in the queue which have been fetched and are

%% Publish a message.

                  state()) -> state().

%% Called for messages which have already been passed straight
%% out to a client. The queue will be empty for these calls
%% (i.e. saves the round trip through the backing queue).
-callback publish_delivered(rabbit_types:basic_message(),

%% Called to inform the BQ about messages which have reached the
%% queue, but are not going to be further passed to BQ for some
%% reason. Note that this may be invoked for messages for which
%% BQ:is_duplicate/2 has already returned {'published' | 'discarded',
%% BQS}.
-callback discard(rabbit_types:msg_id(), pid(), state()) -> state().

%% Return ids of messages which have been confirmed since the last
%% invocation of this function (or initialisation).
%%
%% Message ids should only appear in the result of drain_confirmed
%% under the following circumstances:
%%
%% 1. The message appears in a call to publish_delivered/4 and the
%%    first argument (ack_required) is false; or
%% 2. The message is fetched from the queue with fetch/2 and the first
%%    argument (ack_required) is false; or
%% 3. The message is acked (ack/2 is called for the message); or
%% 4. The message is fully fsync'd to disk in such a way that the
%%    recovery of the message is guaranteed in the event of a crash of
%%    this rabbit node (excluding hardware failure).
%%
%% In addition to the above conditions, a message id may only appear
%% in the result of drain_confirmed if
%% #message_properties.needs_confirming = true when the msg was
%% published (through whichever means) to the backing queue.
%%
%% It is legal for the same message id to appear in the results of
%% multiple calls to drain_confirmed, which means that the backing
%% queue is not required to keep track of which messages it has
%% already confirmed. The confirm will be issued to the publisher the
%% first time the message id appears in the result of
%% drain_confirmed. All subsequent appearances of that message id will
%% be ignored.
-callback drain_confirmed(state()) -> {msg_ids(), state()}.

%% Drop messages from the head of the queue while the supplied
%% predicate on message properties returns true. Returns the first
%% message properties for which the predictate returned false, or
%% 'undefined' if the whole backing queue was traversed w/o the
%% predicate ever returning false.
-callback dropwhile(msg_pred(), state())
                   -> {rabbit_types:message_properties() | undefined, state()}.

%% Like dropwhile, except messages are fetched in "require
%% acknowledgement" mode and are passed, together with their ack tag,
%% to the supplied function. The function is also fed an
%% accumulator. The result of fetchwhile is as for dropwhile plus the
%% accumulator.
-callback fetchwhile(msg_pred(), msg_fun(A), A, state())

                         A, state()}.

%% Produce the next message.
-callback fetch(true,  state()) -> {fetch_result(ack()), state()};
               (false, state()) -> {fetch_result(undefined), state()}.

%% Remove the next message.
-callback drop(true,  state()) -> {drop_result(ack()), state()};
              (false, state()) -> {drop_result(undefined), state()}.

%% Acktags supplied are for messages which can now be forgotten
%% about. Must return 1 msg_id per Ack, in the same order as Acks.
-callback ack([ack()], state()) -> {msg_ids(), state()}.

%% Reinsert messages into the queue which have already been delivered
%% and were pending acknowledgement.
-callback requeue([ack()], state()) -> {msg_ids(), state()}.

%% Fold over messages by ack tag. The supplied function is called with
%% each message, its ack tag, and an accumulator.
-callback ackfold(msg_fun(A), A, state(), [ack()]) -> {A, state()}.

%% Fold over all the messages in a queue and return the accumulated
%% results, leaving the queue undisturbed.
-callback fold(fun((rabbit_types:basic_message(),
                    rabbit_types:message_properties(),
                    boolean(), A) -> {('stop' | 'cont'), A}),

%% How long is my queue?
-callback len(state()) -> non_neg_integer().

%% Is my queue empty?
-callback is_empty(state()) -> boolean().

%% What's the queue depth, where depth = length + number of pending acks
-callback depth(state()) -> non_neg_integer().

%% For the next three functions, the assumption is that you're
%% monitoring something like the ingress and egress rates of the
%% queue. The RAM duration is thus the length of time represented by
%% the messages held in RAM given the current rates. If you want to
%% ignore all of this stuff, then do so, and return 0 in
%% ram_duration/1.

%% The target is to have no more messages in RAM than indicated by the
%% duration and the current queue rates.
-callback set_ram_duration_target(duration(), state()) -> state().

%% Optionally recalculate the duration internally (likely to be just
%% update your internal rates), and report how many seconds the
%% messages in RAM represent given the current rates of the queue.
-callback ram_duration(state()) -> {duration(), state()}.

%% Should 'timeout' be called as soon as the queue process can manage
%% (either on an empty mailbox, or when a timer fires)?
-callback needs_timeout(state()) -> 'false' | 'timed' | 'idle'.

%% Called (eventually) after needs_timeout returns 'idle' or 'timed'.
%% Note this may be called more than once for each 'idle' or 'timed'
%% returned from needs_timeout
-callback timeout(state()) -> state().

%% Called immediately before the queue hibernates.
-callback handle_pre_hibernate(state()) -> state().

%% Exists for debugging purposes, to be able to expose state via
%% rabbitmqctl list_queues backing_queue_status
-callback status(state()) -> [{atom(), any()}].

%% Passed a function to be invoked with the relevant backing queue's
%% state. Useful for when the backing queue or other components need
%% to pass functions into the backing queue.
-callback invoke(atom(), fun ((atom(), A) -> A), state()) -> state().

%% Called prior to a publish or publish_delivered call. Allows the BQ
%% to signal that it's already seen this message (and in what capacity
%% - i.e. was it published previously or discarded previously) and
%% thus the message should be dropped.
-callback is_duplicate(rabbit_types:basic_message(), state())
