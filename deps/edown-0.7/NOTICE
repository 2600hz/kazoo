EDown is derived from code in EDoc, and designed to be an extension
to EDoc.

EDoc was written by Richard Carlsson, (c) 2001-2007 Richard Carlsson.
It is part of Erlang/OTP (http://www.erlang.org) and available
via the Erlang Public License (EPL).

Original idea and implementation for EDown: ulf@wiger.net
