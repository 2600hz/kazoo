%% Session window:
%%
%% Each session has two abstract[1] buffers, one to record the
%% unsettled state of incoming messages, one to record the unsettled
%% state of outgoing messages.  In general we want to bound these
%% buffers; but if we bound them, and don't tell the other side, we
%% may end up deadlocking the other party.
%%
%% Hence the flow frame contains a session window, expressed as the
%% next-id and the window size for each of the buffers. The frame
%% refers to the window of the sender of the frame, of course.
%%
%% The numbers work this way: for the outgoing window, the next-id
%% counts the next transfer the session will send, and it will stop
%% sending at next-id + window.  For the incoming window, the next-id
%% counts the next transfer id expected, and it will not accept
%% messages beyond next-id + window (in fact it will probably close
%% the session, since sending outside the window is a transgression of
%% the protocol).
%%
%% We may as well just pick a value for the incoming and outgoing
%% windows; choosing based on what the client says may just stop
%% things dead, if the value is zero for instance.
%%
%% [1] Abstract because there probably won't be a data structure with
%% a size directly related to transfers; settlement is done with
%% delivery-id, which may refer to one or more transfers.
