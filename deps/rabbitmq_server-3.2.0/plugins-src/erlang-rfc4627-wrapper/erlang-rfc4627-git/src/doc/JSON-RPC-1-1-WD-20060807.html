        Overview</h2>
    <p>
        JSON-RPC is a stateless and light-weight remote procedure call (<acronym title="Remote Procedure Call">RPC</acronym>) 
        protocol for inter-networking applications over <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt"><acronym title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym></a>.
        It uses <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt"><acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</acronym></a>
        as the data format for of all facets of a remote 
        procedure call, including all application data carried in parameters.</p>
    <p>
        By leveraging HTTP, JSON-RPC allows implementations to immediately benefit from
        the widely deployed World Wide Web infrastructure that is well-documented and understood
        today. It introduces no new HTTP verbs or message header extensions. JSON-RPC relies on JSON for the format of the HTTP message
        bodies, which allows implementations
        to benefit from a simple and standard text format that
        has suitable representations for the most commonly used scalar and structured data types inapplications. It is being quickly and widely adopted for web applications, and for which
        libraries are readily available in several languages.</p>
    <p>
        The general mechanism for a remote procedure call using JSON-RPC consists of a client establishing
        a connection with a service and then invoking one or more procedures provided by that
        service. A single remote procedure call begins life as a request sent from the client
        to the server. The call ends when the client subsequently receives a response from
        the server over the same connection. Another call on the same connection is only made
        once the previous call has ended.</p>
    <h3 id="Goals">1.1. Goals</h3>
    <p>
        The primary goals of this specification are to define the JSON-RPC 1.1 protocol
        in terms of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expressing a remote procedure call and its result in JSON.</li>
      <li>Using HTTP to transfer the request and response messages
            that make up a remote procedure call.</li>
      <li>Expressing error conditions in JSON and in HTTP.</li>
      <li>Publishing and discovering a simple and machine-readable
            specification of a JSON-RPC service.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="NonGoals">1.2. Non-Goals</h3>
    <p>
        JSON-RPC does not address security, correlation, reliability, sessions
        management, state management and many other features
        that may be found in other RPC protocols or distributed systems. Developers are
        instead encouraged to employ features of HTTP and related Internet technologies that 
        can offer some of these features in an equally compelling, robust and satisfying manner. Some
        features may be defined as extensions by other specifications.</p>
    <h2 id="Differences">2. 
        Differences From Version 1</h2>
    <p>
        The following list (non-comprehensive) summarizes the general changes that have
        been applied to version 1.0:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JSON-RPC 1.1 is bound to HTTP only. Use over other protocols are not considered
            normative according to verson 1.1.</li>
      <li>Renamed request to Procedure Call (capitalization significant).</li>
      <li>Renamed response to Procedure Return (capitalization significant).</li>
      <li>Removed notifications.</li>
      <li>Removed the requirement to specify <strong>id</strong> for regular calls. </li>
      <li>Formalize <code>Content-Type</code> for JSON-RPC.</li>
      <li>Add <code>version</code> member to Procedure Call and Procedure Return objects.</li>
      <li>Formalization of the JSON type system, i.e. Boolean, String, Number, Array, Object and
            the Null value (capitalization significant).</li>
      <li>Added call encoding for HTTP GET.</li>
      <li>Added named and positional arguments. </li>
      <li>Added Error object and formalization of error codes. </li>
      <li>Added introspection (service description) and required system procedures.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="Requirements">3. Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,
        SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY and OPTIONAL in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in 
        <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.</p>
    <p>
        An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
        of the MUST requirements for the protocols it implements.  An
        implementation that satisfies all of the MUST and all of the
        SHOULD requirements for its features is said to be <em>unconditionally
        compliant</em>; one that satisfies all of the 'must' requirements but not
        all of the SHOULD requirements for its features is said to be
        <em>conditionally compliant</em>.</p>
    <h2 id="Terms">4. 
        Terminology</h2>
    <p>
        Below is a summary of some terminology used in this documentation that can help
        in disambiguation of commonly applied and therefore often overloaded terms:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Client</dt>
      <dd>
            The agent that is the initiator of the remote procedure call.</dd>
      <dt>Server</dt>
      <dd>
            Software that implements JSON-RPC, which may hosts one or more JSON-RPC services
            and which also acts as the gateway to lower-level protocols and transports.</dd>
      <dt>Service</dt>
      <dd>
            Provider of one or more procedures that may be the target of remote procedure calls
            by clients.</dd>
      <dt>Procedure</dt>
      <dd>
            A named operation on a service that may be the target of a remote procedure call.
            In this document, the terms method and procedure are used to mean the same thing.
        </dd>
      <dt>Method</dt>
      <dd>
            Same as Procedure.
        </dd>
      <dt>Call</dt>
      <dd>
            An invocation of a procedure on a service that results in a 
            sequential request-response transaction
            between the client and the server.</dd>
      <dt>Request</dt>
      <dd>
            The message that frames a call and its parameters.</dd>
      <dt>Response</dt>
      <dd>
            The message that frames the result of a successful call or the error in the case
            of a failed call.</dd>
      <dt>Result</dt>
      <dd>
            The answer for a successful call.</dd>
      <dt>Error</dt>
      <dd>
            The answer for a failed call.</dd>
      <dt>Notification</dt>
      <dd>
            A one-way (fire and forget) call that produces no results, including
            any indication of error.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2 id="TypeSystem">5. 
        Type System</h2>
    <p>
        JSON-RPC shares the same type system as JSON to specify all value components of
        a call. In its abstract form (grammatic and syntatic details aside), JSON can represent
        four primitive types—String, Number, Booleans, and Null—and two structured types—Object
        and Array—that are briefly defined here:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>String</dt>
      <dd>
            A sequence of zero or more Unicode characters.
        </dd>
      <dt>Number</dt>
      <dd>
            An integer component optionally prefixed with a minus sign and which may be followed
            by a fraction part and/or an exponent part.</dd>
      <dt>Boolean</dt>
      <dd>
            Literally <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</dd>
      <dt>Null</dt>
      <dd>
            Literally <code>null</code>.</dd>
      <dt>Array</dt>
      <dd>
            An ordered sequence of zero or more elements, where each element hola value is a
            String, Number, Boolean, Null, Object or another Array. The index of the first element
            is zero and increments by one for each subequent element.</dd>
      <dt>Object</dt>
      <dd>
            An unordered collection of zero or more members. Each member is a name/value
            pair, where a name is a String, and a value is a String, Number, Boolean, Null,
            Array or another Object.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        For the remainder of this document, it is expected that the reader has some 
        familiarity with the basic syntax of JSON text. Otherwise, consult the 
        <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">JSON specification (RFC 4627)</a>
        for further details.</p>
    <div class="ednote">
      <span class="editor">Atif Aziz:</span> It may be worth mentioning here how this specification makes a distinction
        between <em>JSON</em>, the abstract type system, and <em>JSON text</em>, the syntax
        for serializing the values. In XML parlance, JSON is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">
            InfoSet</a> and JSON text is the equivalent of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/">XML
                1.0</a>.</div>
    <p>
        This document also uses a specific convention to refer to any JSON type. 
        Wherever a JSON type is mentioned, the first letter is always capitalized
        and the whole word appears in its root form (never in its 
        plural form).</p>
    <h2 id="ProcedureCall">6. 
        Procedure Call (Request)</h2>
    <p>
        A remote procedure call is made by sending a request to a remote service
        using either
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5">HTTP POST</a> or
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.3">HTTP GET</a>.
        How and where the call is encoded within the HTTP message depends on the HTTP 
        method that is employed. In the case of HTTP POST, the procedure call is 
        carried in the body of the HTTP message whereas in the case of HTTP GET, it
        is expressed along the path and query components of the 
        <a href="cvhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.1.2">HTTP Request-URI</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Suppose that a service exposes a procedure named <code>sum</code> that takes two Number parameters,
        as in <code>sum(a, b)</code>, and returns their sum. 
        The HTTP POST to call this procedure call would be as follows:</p>
    <div class="exampleOuter">
      <div class="exampleHeader">
            Procedure Call Example Using HTTP POST</div>
      <div class="exampleInner">
        <pre>POST /myservice HTTP/1.1 
User-Agent: Wget/1.6
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 181
Accept: application/json

{
    "version" : "1.1",
    "method"  : "sum",
    "params"  : [ 17, 25 ]
}</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        In this example, the method being targeted is provided by a 
        service located at <code>http://www.example.com/myservice</code>.
        The call is expressed as a JSON Object in the body of the HTTP
        POST message. The <code>version</code> member of this object tells 
        the receiver the version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used by the 
        client. The <code>method</code> member indicates the procedure
        being invoked, which is <em>sum</em> in this example. Finally,
        the <code>params</code> member contains a JSON Array that lists
        the parameters (in order) to be supplied to the procedure.</p>
    <p>
        The same invocation is shown here using HTTP GET:</p>
    <div class="exampleOuter">
      <div class="exampleHeader">
            Procedure Call Example Using HTTP GET</div>
      <div class="exampleInner">
        <pre>GET /myservice/sum?a=17&amp;b=25 HTTP/1.1 
User-Agent: Wget/1.6
Host: www.example.com
Accept: application/json

</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        There are two distinctions from the HTTP POST version that are
        improtant to note. First, an HTTP GET targeting a procedure on
        a JSON-RPC service is largely indistinguishable from a regular
        HTTP GET transaction. For this reason, there is no mention of
        of the JSON-RPC protocol version being used. Second, the entire
        call is encoded in the HTTP Request-URI. The procedure to invoke 
        is appended to the location of the service, such that it appears 
        as the last component of the URI path component. The call 
        parameters appear as the query component and are named after
        the formal arguments of the target procedure.</p>
    <h3 id="RequestHeaders">6.1. HTTP Header Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        Regardless of whether a remote procedure call is made using

    </ul>
    <h3 id="PostProcedureCall">6.2. Call Encoding Using HTTP POST</h3>
    <p>
        When using HTTP POST, the call is expressed in the HTTP request body as a JSON Object
        that carries the following members:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>id</dt>
      <dd>
            OPTIOINAL. A request identifier that can be of any JSON type. This member is 
            essentially maintained for backward compatibility with version 1.0 of the specification 
            where it was used to correlate a response with its request. If this member is present 
            then the server MUST repeat it verbatim on the response.</dd>
      <dt>version</dt>
      <dd>
            REQUIRED. A String specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol to which
            the client conforms. An implementation conforming to this specification MUST
            use the exact String value of <code>"1.1"</code> for this member.</dd>
      <dt>method</dt>
      <dd>
            REQUIRED.
            A String containing the name of the procedure to be invoked. Procedure names
            that begin with the word <code>system</code> followed by a period character (U+002E
            or ASCII 46) are reserved. In other words, a procedure named <code>system.foobar</code>
            is considered to have reserved semantics.
            <div class="ednote"><span class="editor">Atif Aziz:</span> Ideally, this member would 
            have been named <code>proc</code> to reflect the <em>procedure</em> in RPC, but 
            is being left as <code>method</code> for sake of compatibility. One could permit
            both, but that could unnecessarily increase complexity.
            In the text of this document, however, I have tried to stick to the term procedure.
            If anyone spots any use of the <em>word</em> method, except references to the 
            <em>member</em><code>method</code>,
            then please let me know.</div></dd>
      <dt>params</dt>
      <dd>
            OPTIONAL. An Array or Object that holds the actual parameter values for the invocation
            of the procedure.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        Unless a call is for notification purposes
        only, bearing one-way semantics, it MUST be replied to with a response.</p>
    <h4 id="NamedPositionalParameters">6.2.1. 
        Named and Positional Parameters</h4>
    <p>
        Parameters for a procedure call can be identified by their name, position, or both. The name and position
        of a parameter is defined by the formal argument list of the
        target procedure. The first position is zero and increments by one for each subsequent
        formal argument.</p>
    <p>
        A client can specify parameters by-name, by-position or both using a JSON Object
        as the value for the <span style="font-family: Courier New">params</span> member. Each member
        of this object becomes a candidate parameter for the call. If the name
        of the object member consists
        entirely of decimal digits (0-9) then it identifies the parameter
        by its position in the formal argument list. In all other instances, the member name identifies the parameter
        by its name and MUST match exactly (including in case) the name defined by the formal argument.</p>
    <p>
        Suppose a remote procedure called <em>sum</em> that defines three formal arguments called
        <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.
        Suppose further that <code>a</code> comes first in the argument list, <code>b</code> second and <code>c</code>
        third. The following example shows how this procedure would be called using named parameters in an HTTP POST transaction (the
        headers have been omitted from all examples in this section for sake of brevity):</p>
    <div class="exampleOuter">
      <div class="exampleHeader">
            Procedure Call With Named Parameters (1)</div>
      <div class="exampleInner">
        <pre>{
    "version" : "1.1",
    "method"  : "sum",
    "params"  : { "a" : 12, "b" : 34, "c" : 56 }
}</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Since parameters are identified by their name, the order is insignificant. The same
        MAY be expressed
        with parameters appearing in a different order than which is defined by the formal argument list:</p>
    <div class="exampleOuter">
      <div class="exampleHeader">
            Procedure Call With Named Parameters (2)</div>
      <div class="exampleInner">
        <pre>{
    "version" : "1.1",
    "method"  : "sum",
    "params"  : { "b" : 34, "c" : 56, "a" : 12 }
}</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        A client MAY choose to send all or some of the paramters by-position, in or out
        of sequence. The example
        below shows the same call being expressed with parameters
        <code>a</code> and
        <code>b</code> named after their positions
        in the formal argument list:</p>
    <div class="exampleOuter">
      <div class="exampleHeader">
            Procedure Call With Named and Positional Parameters</div>
      <div class="exampleInner">
        <pre>{
    "version" : "1.1",
    "method"  : "sum",
    "params"  : { "1" : 34, "c" : 56, "0" : 12 }
}</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        If a client chooses to send parameters exclusively by their position, then it MAY
        use a JSON Array for the <code>params</code> member of the <a href="#PostProcedureCall">Procedure Call</a> object as a terser
        method:</p>
    <div class="exampleOuter">
      <div class="exampleHeader">
            Procedure Call With Positional Parameters Only (Using JSON Array)</div>
      <div class="exampleInner">

    "method"  : "sum",
    "params"  : [ 12, 34, 56 ]
}</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        A server MUST accept all forms of parameter expressions described in this section.
        The last case, where parameters are sent in an array, was the only one supported
        in JSON-RPC 1.0. Servers conforming to JSON-RPC 1.1 can therefore continue to support
        calls from existing JSON-RPC 1.0 clients.</p>
    <p>
        If the value of the params member is any other type except JSON Object or Array,
        then the server MUST reject the call with an error.</p>
    <div class="ednote">
      <span class="editor">Atif Aziz:</span> Need to add a comment about which
        error should be specifically returned if the <code>params</code> member
        is neither JSON Object or Array.

    <h4 id="ChoosingNamedPositionalParameters">6.2.2. 
        Choosing Between Named and Positional Parameters</h4>
    <p>
        Calls that identify all parameters exclusively by-name are RECOMMENDED over any
        positional parameters for the following reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The call appears more readable and self-contained on the wire, which can aid in
            logging and diagnosis without having to constantly consult the procudure definitions.
        </li>
      <li>The client gains independence from any change in the order of the formal argument
            list.</li>
      <li>If the formal argument list is large and mostly optional, the client can send only
            those parameters by-name that it needs to fulfill the purpose of a particular call.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="NullParameters">6.2.3. 
        Null Parameters</h4>
    <p>
        The Null value MAY be used as the value of any parameter and MUST be taken to mean
        that the parameter is not being supplied for the call.</p>
    <h4 id="MemberSequence">6.2.4. 
        Member Sequence</h4>
    <p>
        Client implementations SHOULD strive to order the members of the <a href="#PostProcedureCall">Procedure Call</a>
        object such that the server is able to employ a streaming strategy to process the contents. 
        At the very least, a client SHOULD ensure that the <code>version</code> member 
        appears first and the <code>params</code> member last. 
        An example how this can be an advantage is 
        where a client tries to invoke a procedure that does not exist on the target service. The server can then skip to the end and issue an error as soon as it reads
        the value of the <code>method</code> member and finds it to be in error.</p>
    <div class="ednote">
      <span class="editor">Atif Aziz:</span>
        Allow a server to refuse a request if it does not wish to process a request
        where the <code>params</code> member appears before <code>method</code>.</div>
    <h3 id="GetProcedureCall">6.3. 
        Call Encoding Using HTTP GET</h3>
    <p>
        When using HTTP GET, the target procedure and parameters for the call are entirely
        expressed within the Request-URI of the HTTP message. The target procedure
        MUST appear as the last component of the Request-URI path component. The
        procedure's name MUST therefore be preceded by a forward-slash (U+002F or ASCII
        47) but MUST NOT end in one.</p>
    <p>
        The parameters are placed in the <em>query component</em> (as defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/3986">
            RFC 3986</a>) of the Request-URI, which is then formatted using the same scheme as defined
        for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html">HTML Forms</a> with
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-method"><code>get</code> method</a>.
        Each parameters consists of a name/position and value pair that is separated by
        the equal sign (U+003D or ASCII 61) and parameters themselves are separated by an
        ampersand (U+0026 or ASCII 38):</p>
    <p>
      <code>name<sub>1</sub>=value<sub>1</sub>&amp;name<sub>2</sub>=value<sub>2</sub>&amp;name<sub>3</sub>=value<sub>3</sub>…</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        A client MAY send the parameters in a different order than in which the formal
        argument list of the target procedure defines them.</p>
    <h4 id="EncodingGetParameters">6.3.1. Encoding of Call Parameter Values</h4>
    <p>
        The client MUST NOT use the JSON syntax for the parameter
        values. All values MUST be plain text and observe the escaping rules defined
        for the query component of the URL. After decoding, the server MUST treat all values 
        as if they were sent as JSON String values. The server MAY then perform conversions at 
        its discretion (on a best-attempt basis) if the formal arguments of the target 
        procedure expects other non-String values. This specification does not define any conversion rules or methods.</p>
    <p>
        Parameters named identically on the query string MUST be collapsed
        into an Array of String values using the same order in which they appear in the query string and
        identified by the repeating parameter name. For instance, the following query string specifies two parameters only,
        namely <code>scale</code> and <code>city</code>:</p>
    <p>
      <code>city=london&amp;scale=farenheit&amp;city=zurich&amp;city=new+york</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        The parameter <code>scale</code> has the single String value of <code>"farenheit"</code> whereas 
        <code>city</code> is an Array of String values equivalent to the JSON text <code>[ "london", "zurich", "new york" ]</code>.</p>
    <p>
        It is specifically not possible to send parameters of type Object using HTTP GET.</p>
    <h4 id="IdempotentProcedures">6.3.2. 
        Safe and Idempotent Procedures Only</h4>
    <p>
        Due to semantics and therefore requirements of HTTP GET, only procedures that are
        considered safe and idempotent MAY be invoked using HTTP GET. An explanation of what is considered safe and idempotent is provided in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1">
            Section 9.1 (Safe and Idempotent Methods)</a> of HTTP 1.1 specificiation. A
        server SHOULD provide a means (through a configuration file, for example) for a
        service to indicate which of its procedures are safe and idempotent in order to
        be callable using HTTP GET. In the absence of such means on the other hand, the
        server MUST allow invocations using HTTP POST only.</p>
    <p>
        A server MUST respond with an error if a client attempts to invoke a procedure that
        has not been designated by the service as safe for call using HTTP GET.</p>
    <p>
        A procedure callable using HTTP GET SHOULD also be callable using HTTP POST.</p>
    <h3 id="ChoosingBetweenPostGet">6.4. Choosing Between HTTP POST and GET</h3>
    <p>
        The choice of the HTTP method for a remote procedure call depends on
        the consequences of calling the procedure as well as the benefits afforded by each of the two HTTP
        methods. In general, any remote procedure call can be made using HTTP POST, but
        some benefits</p>
    <p>
        HTTP GET can be particularly useful when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The procedure is safe, idempotent and compatible with HTTP GET semantics. Therefore
            it produces information without causing side-effects.</li>
      <li>The procedure has only arguments that are compatible with scalar JSON types Boolean,
            Number and String.</li>
      <li>Performance benefits can be leveraged through client-side caching as well as caching
            on HTTP proxy infrastructure that is widely available and deployed over intranets
            and on the Internet.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="NameSensitivity">6.5.  Case-Sensitivity of Procedure and Parameter Names</h3>
    <p>
        Conforming implementations MUST treat procedure and parameter names as being case-sensitive such the names <code>bar</code> and <code>BAR</code> would be 
        seen as two distinct entities.</p>
    <h3 id="ProcedureCallParity">6.6. 
        Procedure Call Parity</h3>
    <p>
        The parity of a procedure call is defined by how closely it matches the target procedure's
        formal definition and argument list. A call is on full parity with the target procedure
        when it meets all of the following conditions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>All parameters were supplied and none had the Null value.</li>
      <li>No extra parameters were supplied.</li>
      <li>The values for each parameter matched exactly the expected type.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Note that when parameters are named by-position or by-name, their sequence does
        not change or contribute to the parity of the call. A call can have full parity
        with its procedure even if the parameters were not sent in the sequence of the formal
        argument list.</p>
    <h4 id="CallApproximation">6.6.1. 
        Call Approximation</h4>
    <p>
        A server SHOULD try to adapt a call such that it has the greatest chance of
        succeeding by making the following adjustments for the actual invocation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the call supplies fewer parameters than expected then the missing parameters
            SHOULD assume the Null value. </li>
      <li>If the call supplies more parameters than expected then they MAY be dropped prior
            to invocation. A server MAY however, provide a means for a procedure to receive
            the excess parameters if necessary (for example by allowing a variable-length argument
            list).</li>
      <li>Make reasonable conversions between the actual and expected type of a parameter.
            The eventual conversion methods and policies applied to approximate a call are left
            at the discretion of the server and service, but both SHOULD strive to avoid conversions
            that cause any loss or precision of data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="ProcedureReturn">7. 
        Procedure Return (Response)</h2>
    <p>
        When a remote procedure call is made, the service MUST reply with a response whether
        the invocation was successful or not.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ResponseStatusCodes">7.1. 
        HTTP Status Code Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        When the call is made using HTTP POST, the HTTP status code for a successful result
        MUST be 200.</p>
    <p>
        When the call is made using HTTP GET, the HTTP status code for a successful result
        SHOULD be 200. If the HTTP GET call requested cache validation as well, the response
        MAY be <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.5">304 (Not Modified)</a>.
        The use of status codes generally related to redirection (e.g., <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3">302 “Found”</a> or
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.2">301 “Moved Permanently”</a>) of HTTP GET transactions is not strictly prohibited, but service providers are RECOMMENDED
        instead to use public documentation and communication methods to advertise the relocation
        of a service.</p>
    <p>
        Clients SHOULD be prepared to handle a status code of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.2">
            401 (Unauthorized)</a> resulting from an authentication challenge when a call
        is sent anonymously.</p>

        500 (Internal Server Error)</a> MUST be used under the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There was an error parsing the JSON text comprising the Procedure Call.</li>
      <li>The target procedure does not exist on the server. For HTTP GET, a server SHOULD
            use <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.5">404 (Not
                Found)</a> instead of 500.</li>

      <li>The invocation took place but resulted in an error from inside the procedure. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="ResponseHeaders">7.2. HTTP Header Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        Regardless of the HTTP method used to make the remote procedure call, the HTTP response message MUST specify the following headers:</p>

      <li>The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17">Content-Type</a></code> MUST be specified and SHOULD read <code>application/json</code>.</li>
      <li>The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13">Content-Length</a></code> MUST be specified and correct according

        Procedure Return Object</h3>
    <p>
        Regardless of the HTTP method used to make the remote procedure call, the response
        body MUST be a JSON Object that carries the following properties or members:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>id</dt>
      <dd>
            OPTIONAL. This MUST be the same value as that of the <code>id</code> member
            of Procedure
            Call object to which the response corresponds. This member is maintained
            for backward compatibility with version 1.0 of the specification where it was used
            to correlate a response with its request. If the <code>id</code> member was
            present on the request, then the server MUST repeat it verbatim on the response.</dd>
      <dt>version</dt>
      <dd>
            REQUIRED. A String specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol to which the
            client conforms. An implementation conforming to this specification MUST use the
            exact String value of <code>"1.1"</code> for this member. The absence of this member
            can effectively be taken to mean that the remote server implement version 1.0 of
            the JSON-RPC protocol.</dd>
      <dt>result</dt>
      <dd>
            REQUIRED on success. The value that was returned by the procedure upon a successful invocation.
            This member MUST be entirely omitted in case there
            was an error invoking the procedure.</dd>
      <dt>error</dt>
      <dd>
            REQUIRED on error. An Object containing error information about the fault that occured before,
            during or after the call. This member MUST be entirely omitted if there
            was no error.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        Only one of <code>result</code> or <code>error</code> members MUST be specified, but never both. If both are missing, then the Procedure Return should be treated
        as if it had the value Null.</p>

        When a remote procedure call fails, the Procedure Return object MUST contain the <code>error</code>
        member whose value is a JSON Object with the following properties
        members:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>name</dt>
      <dd>REQUIRED. A String value that MUST read <code>"JSONRPCError"</code>.</dd>
      <dt>code</dt>
      <dd>REQUIRED. A Number value that indicates the actual error that occurred. This MUST
            be an integer between 100 and 999.</dd>
      <dt>message</dt>

        Processing Model</h2>
    <p>
        The processing model for the treatment of a remote procedure call is outlined as
        follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determine the HTTP method of the Procedure Call.</li>
      <li>Decode the call using the rules laid out for HTTP PSO</li>
      <li>Rearrange the parameter order according to the formal argument list of the procedure.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="Services">9. 
        Services</h2>
    <p>
        A JSON-RPC service MUST, at a mimum, support a procedure called <code>system.describe</code>.
        The result of calling this procedure without any parameters MUST be a <a href="#ServiceDescription">
            Service Description</a>
        object as described in the next section.</p>
    <h2 id="ServiceDescription">10. 
        Service Description</h2>
    <p>
        A service description is a JSON Object with the following members or properties:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>sdversion</dt>
      <dd>
            REQUIRED. A String value that represents the version number of this object and MUST read <code>"1.0"</code> for conforming implementations.</dd>
      <dt>name</dt>
      <dd>
            REQUIRED. A String value that provides a simple name for the method.</dd>
      <dt>id</dt>
      <dd>
            REQUIRED. A String value that uniquely and globally identifies the service. The
            string MUST use the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">URI Generic Syntax
                (RFC 3986)</a>.
        </dd>
      <dt>version</dt>
      <dd>
            OPTIONAL. A String value that indicates version number of the service and MAY be
            used by the applications for checking compatibility. The version number, when present,
            MUST include a major and minor component separated by a period (U+002E or ASCII 46). The major and minor components MUST use decimal digits (0 to 9) only.
            For example, use <code>"2.5"</code> to mean a major version of 2 and a minor version
            of 5. The use and interpretation of the version number is left at the discretion
            of the applications treating the Service Description.</dd>
      <dt>summary</dt>
      <dd>
            OPTIONAL. A String value that summarizes the purpose of the service. This SHOULD
            be kept to a maximum of 5 sentences and often limited a single phrase like,
            “The News Search service allows you to search the Internet for news stories.”

      <dd>
            OPTIONAL. A String value that is the URL of the service end-point to which the remote
            procedure calls can be targeted. The protocol scheme of this URL SHOULD be <code>http</code>
            or <code>https</code>. Although this value is optional, it is highly RECOMMENDED that a service always publish its address so that a service description obtained
            indirectly can be used nonetheless to locate the service.</dd>

      <dd>
            OPTIONAL. An Array value whose element contain Service Procedure Description objects,

      <dt>idempotent </dt>
      <dd>
            OPTIONAL. A Boolean value that indicates whether the procedure is idempotent and

            objects or String values. If an element each of uniquely describes a single
            parameter of the procedure. If the only description that is available of each parameter
            is its name, then a service MAY instead supply an Array of String elements for this
            member and where each element uniquely names a parameter and the
            parameter is assumed to be typed as <code>"any"</code>. In either case, the elements
            of the array MUST be ordered after the formal argument list of the procedure being
            described. If this member is missing or the Null value then the procedure does not
            expect any parameters.</dd>
      <dt>return</dt>
      <dd>
            OPTIONAL. An Object value that is structured after the <a href="#ProcedureParameterDescription">Procedure
                Parameter Description</a>
            and which describes the output from the procedure. Otherwise, if it is a String value, then it defines the type of the return value.
            If this member is missing or
            is the Null value then the return type of the procedure is defined to be <code>"any"</code>.</dd>

      <dt>name</dt>
      <dd>
            REQUIRED. A String value that provides a simple name for parameter.</dd>
      <dt>type</dt>
      <dd>OPTIONAL. A String value that denotes the expected value type for the parameter. If this member is not supplied or is the Null value then the type is

        If another String value is found then it must be treated the same
        as <code>"any"</code>.</p>
    <p>
        The <code>"nil"</code> string MUST NOT be used to describe the type of a procedure's
        formal argument. Rather, it is strictly reserved to denote the return type of a procedure
        that is not expected to produce a result. In other words, the <code>result</code> member of the
        Procedure Return object resulting from a call to such procedure is
        not interesting because it will always be the Null value.</p>

            Accept-Language</a> header from the HTTP request message to deliver a localized
        text for its String value. Likewise, the URL for the <code>help</code> members MAY 
        also point a page that contains the localized documentation. However, the documentation
        at the URL SHOULD also provide hyperlinks to the documentation in other languages
        if the translations are available.</p>
    <h2 id="NameCharacters">11. 
        Service, Procedure and Parameter Names</h2>
    <p>
        In JSON-RPC, service, procedure, parameters identifiable by name. The names of all
        these artifacts SHOULD only include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uppercase alphabets A to Z (U+0041 to U+005A, ASCII 65 to 90)</li>
      <li>Lowercase alphabets A to Z
            (U+0061 to U+007A, ASCII 97 to 122)</li>
      <li>Decimal digits 0 to 9 (U+0030 to U+0039, ASCII 48
            to 57)</li>
      <li>Hyphen (U+002D, ASCII 45)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All other characters in a name, although not technically excluded here, could severely
        limit the reach of the service and its procedures given certain environments, scenarios
        and especially programming languages.</p>
    <h2 id="ObjectExtensions">12. 
        Object Extensions</h2>
    <p>
        Objects defined in this specification (<a href="#PostProcedureCall">Procedure Call</a>, <a href="#ProcedureReturn">Procedure Return</a>, <a href="#ErrorObject">Error</a>)
        MAY contain additional members not specifically
        mentioned. Such
        member names SHOULD be prefixed with the Dollar sign (U+0024 or ASCII 36), as in <code>$extension</code>.</p>
    <div class="ednote">
      <span class="editor">Atif Aziz:</span>
        The reason for choosing the Dollar sign is related to the JavaScript heritage.
        According to the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript 
        Language Specification (ECMA-262)</a>, “The Dollar sign is intended for use only in
        mechanically generated code.” Although the general convention in Internet
        protocols is to use the letter X followed by a dash (U+002D
        or ASCII 45), as in <code>x-extension</code>, the Dollar sign seems like a more natural
        and appropriate fit for JSON-RPC. <em>Should we really be caring about the JavaScript/JSON
        heritage in a communication protocol?</em> One downside of using Dollar sign is that
        it reserved in the Query component of the 
        <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">URI Generic Syntax (RFC 2396)</a>.

    <h2 id="OverallLimitations">13. 
        Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        It is worth noting that JSON-RPC is limited by the inability to represent cyclic
        object graphs in JSON text. Therefore implementations SHOULD take care that parent-child,
        sibling and cross-reference relationships result in error at the client end when
        making the remote procedure call or server end when responding with the result of
        the call. There are two possible ways to control this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configure
        a maximum allowed size of the request and response messages produced for a remote
        procedure call.</li>
      <li>Configure a maximum depth of nesting of Array and Object values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As soon as either configured limit is breached, the client or server fail the call
        with an error.</p>
