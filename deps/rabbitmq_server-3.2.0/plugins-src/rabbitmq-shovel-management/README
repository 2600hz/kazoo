Adds information on shovel status to the management plugin. Build it
like any other plugin.

If you have a heterogenous cluster (where the nodes have different
plugins installed), this should be installed on the same nodes as the
management plugin.

Strictly speaking the shovel does not need to be installed, but then
it won't tell you much.

The HTTP API is very simple: GET /api/shovels.
