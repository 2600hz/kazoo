# Domain Research Step 2: Industry Analysis

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ Search the web to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts
- 📋 YOU ARE AN INDUSTRY ANALYST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on market size, growth, and industry dynamics
- 🔍 WEB SEARCH REQUIRED - verify current facts against live sources
- 📝 WRITE CONTENT IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- 📝 WRITE INDUSTRY ANALYSIS TO DOCUMENT IMMEDIATELY
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]` before loading next step
- ⚠️ Present [C] continue option after writing content to document

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from step-01 are available
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - established from initial discussion
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - established from initial discussion
- Focus on market size, growth, and industry dynamics
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct industry analysis focusing on market size, growth, and industry dynamics. Search the web to verify and supplement current facts.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Industry Analysis

**UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS**: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different industry areas simultaneously and thoroughly.

Start with industry research approach:
"Now I'll conduct **industry analysis** for **{{research_topic}}** to understand market dynamics.

**Industry Analysis Focus:**

- Market size and valuation metrics
- Growth rates and market dynamics
- Market segmentation and structure
- Industry trends and evolution patterns
- Economic impact and value creation

**Let me search for current industry insights.**"

### 2. Parallel Industry Research Execution

**Execute multiple web searches simultaneously:**

Search the web: "{{research_topic}} market size value"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} market growth rate dynamics"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} market segmentation structure"
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} industry trends evolution"

**Analysis approach:**

- Look for recent market research reports and industry analyses
- Search for authoritative sources (market research firms, industry associations)
- Identify market size, growth rates, and segmentation data
- Research industry trends and evolution patterns
- Analyze economic impact and value creation metrics

### 3. Analyze and Aggregate Results

**Collect and analyze findings from all parallel searches:**

"After executing comprehensive parallel web searches, let me analyze and aggregate industry findings:

**Research Coverage:**

- Market size and valuation analysis
- Growth rates and market dynamics
- Market segmentation and structure
- Industry trends and evolution patterns

**Cross-Industry Analysis:**
[Identify patterns connecting market dynamics, segmentation, and trends]

**Quality Assessment:**
[Overall confidence levels and research gaps identified]"

### 4. Generate Industry Analysis Content

**WRITE IMMEDIATELY TO DOCUMENT**

Prepare industry analysis with web search citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown
## Industry Analysis

### Market Size and Valuation

[Market size analysis with source citations]
_Total Market Size: [Current market valuation]_
_Growth Rate: [CAGR and market growth projections]_

_Source: [URL]_

### Market Dynamics and Growth

[Market dynamics analysis with source citations]
_Growth Drivers: [Key factors driving market growth]_
_Growth Barriers: [Factors limiting market expansion]_
_Cyclical Patterns: [Industry seasonality and cycles]_
_Market Maturity: [Life cycle stage and development phase]_
_Source: [URL]_

### Market Structure and Segmentation

[Market structure analysis with source citations]
_Primary Segments: [Key market segments and their characteristics]_
_Sub-segment Analysis: [Detailed breakdown of market sub-segments]_
_Geographic Distribution: [Regional market variations and concentrations]_

_Barriers to Entry: [Obstacles for new market entrants]_
_Innovation Pressure: [Rate of innovation and change]_
_Source: [URL]_
```

### 5. Present Analysis and Continue Option

**Show analysis and present continue option:**

"I've completed **industry analysis** for {{research_topic}}.

**Key Industry Findings:**

- Market size and valuation thoroughly analyzed
- Growth dynamics and market structure documented
- Industry trends and evolution patterns identified
- Competitive dynamics clearly mapped
- Multiple sources verified for critical insights

**Ready to proceed to competitive landscape analysis?**
[C] Continue - Save this to document and proceed to competitive landscape

### 6. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- **CONTENT ALREADY WRITTEN TO DOCUMENT**
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]`
- Load: `{project-root}/_evo/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/research/domain-steps/step-03-competitive-landscape.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

Content is already written to document when generated in step 4. No additional append needed.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Market size and valuation thoroughly analyzed
✅ Growth dynamics and market structure documented
✅ Industry trends and evolution patterns identified
✅ Competitive dynamics clearly mapped
✅ Multiple sources verified for critical insights
✅ Content written immediately to document
✅ [C] continue option presented and handled correctly
✅ Proper routing to next step (competitive landscape)
✅ Research goals alignment maintained

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Relying on training data instead of web search for current facts
❌ Missing critical market size or growth data
❌ Incomplete market structure analysis
❌ Not identifying key industry trends
❌ Not writing content immediately to document
❌ Not presenting [C] continue option after content generation
❌ Not routing to competitive landscape step

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## INDUSTRY RESEARCH PROTOCOLS:

- Research market research reports and industry analyses
- Use authoritative sources (market research firms, industry associations)
- Analyze market size, growth rates, and segmentation data
- Study industry trends and evolution patterns
- Search the web to verify facts
- Present conflicting information when sources disagree
- Apply confidence levels appropriately

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS STANDARDS:

- Always cite URLs for web search results
- Use authoritative industry research sources
- Note data currency and potential limitations
- Present multiple perspectives when sources conflict
- Apply confidence levels to uncertain data
- Focus on actionable industry insights

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C', load `{project-root}/_evo/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/research/domain-steps/step-03-competitive-landscape.md` to analyze competitive landscape, key players, and ecosystem analysis for {{research_topic}}.

Remember: Always write research content to document immediately and search the web to verify facts!
