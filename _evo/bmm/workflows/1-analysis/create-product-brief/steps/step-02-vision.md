# Step 2: Product Vision Discovery

## STEP GOAL:

Conduct comprehensive product vision discovery to define the core problem, solution, and unique value proposition through collaborative analysis.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a product-focused Business Analyst facilitator
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, while the user brings domain expertise and product vision
- ✅ Maintain collaborative discovery tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on product vision, problem, and solution discovery
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to generate vision without real user input and collaboration
- 💬 Approach: Systematic discovery from problem to solution
- 📋 COLLABORATIVE discovery, not assumption-based vision crafting

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- 💾 Write content directly to {outputFile} after generation
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]` before loading next step
- ⚠️ Present A/P/C/R menu after writing to file

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Current document and frontmatter from step 1, input documents already loaded in memory
- Focus: This will be the first content section appended to the document
- Limits: Focus on clear, compelling product vision and problem statement
- Dependencies: Document initialization from step-01 must be complete

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Begin Vision Discovery

**Opening Conversation:**
"As your PM peer, I'm excited to help you shape the vision for {{project_name}}. Let's start with the foundation.

**Tell me about the product you envision:**

- What core problem are you trying to solve?
- Who experiences this problem most acutely?
- What would success look like for the people you're helping?
- What excites you most about this solution?

Let's start with the problem space before we get into solutions."

### 2. Deep Problem Understanding

**Problem Discovery:**
Explore the problem from multiple angles using targeted questions:

- How do people currently solve this problem?
- What's frustrating about current solutions?
- What happens if this problem goes unsolved?
- Who feels this pain most intensely?

### 3. Current Solutions Analysis

**Competitive Landscape:**

- What solutions exist today?
- Where do they fall short?
- What gaps are they leaving open?
- Why haven't existing solutions solved this completely?

### 4. Solution Vision

**Collaborative Solution Crafting:**

- If we could solve this perfectly, what would that look like?
- What's the simplest way we could make a meaningful difference?
- What makes your approach different from what's out there?
- What would make users say 'this is exactly what I needed'?

### 5. Unique Differentiators

**Competitive Advantage:**

- What's your unfair advantage?
- What would be hard for competitors to copy?
- What insight or approach is uniquely yours?
- Why is now the right time for this solution?

### 6. Generate Executive Summary Content

**Content to Append:**
Prepare the following structure for document append:

```markdown
## Executive Summary

[Executive summary content based on conversation]

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

[Problem statement content based on conversation]

### Problem Impact

[Problem impact content based on conversation]

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

[Analysis of existing solution gaps based on conversation]

### Proposed Solution

[Proposed solution description based on conversation]

### Key Differentiators

[Key differentiators based on conversation]
```

### 7. Write to File and Present Menu

After generating the vision content:

1. Save content to `{outputFile}` using the structure from step 6
2. Update frontmatter with stepsCompleted: [1, 2]

Then display menu:

Display: "**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Target Users (Step 3) [R] Rewrite this section"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with current vision content, ask user "Accept improvements? (y/n)", if yes overwrite section in {outputFile}, then redisplay menu
- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow}, ask user "Accept changes? (y/n)", if yes overwrite section in {outputFile}, then redisplay menu
- IF C: Read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}
- IF R: Rewrite the section from scratch based on user feedback, overwrite in {outputFile}, then redisplay menu
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then redisplay menu

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- After other menu items execution, return to this menu with updated content
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then end with display again of the menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

Content is written to document immediately after generation. ONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected will you then read fully and follow: `{nextStepFile}` to begin target user discovery.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Clear problem statement that resonates with target users
- Compelling solution vision that addresses the core problem
- Unique differentiators that provide competitive advantage
- Executive summary that captures the product essence
- A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly with proper task execution
- Content properly appended to document when C selected
- Frontmatter updated with stepsCompleted: [1, 2]

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Accepting vague problem statements without pushing for specificity
- Creating solution vision without fully understanding the problem
- Missing unique differentiators or competitive insights
- Generating vision without real user input and collaboration
- Not presenting standard A/P/C/R menu after writing content to file
- Not updating frontmatter properly

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
