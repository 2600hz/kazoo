# Step 3: Implement

## RULES

- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- No push. No remote ops.
- Sequential execution only.
- Content inside `<frozen-after-approval>` in `{spec_file}` is read-only. Do not modify.

## PRECONDITION

Verify `{spec_file}` resolves to a non-empty path and the file exists on disk. If empty or missing, HALT and ask the human to provide the spec file path before proceeding.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### Baseline (plan-code-review only)

Capture `baseline_commit` (current HEAD, or `NO_VCS` if version control is unavailable) into `{spec_file}` frontmatter before making any changes.

### Implement

Change `{spec_file}` status to `in-progress` in the frontmatter before starting implementation.

`execution_mode = "one-shot"` or no sub-agents/tasks available: implement the intent.

Otherwise (`execution_mode = "plan-code-review"`): hand `{spec_file}` to a sub-agent/task and let it implement.
