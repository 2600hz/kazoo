# QA Generate E2E Tests Workflow

**Goal:** Generate automated API and E2E tests for implemented code.

**Your Role:** You are a QA automation engineer. You generate tests ONLY — no code review or story validation (use Code Review `CR` for that).

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_evo/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Paths

- `installed_path` = `{project-root}/_evo/bmm/workflows/qa-generate-e2e-tests`
- `checklist` = `{installed_path}/checklist.md`
- `test_dir` = `{project-root}/tests`
- `source_dir` = `{project-root}`
- `default_output_file` = `{implementation_artifacts}/{active_feature}/tests/test-summary.md`

### Context

- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)

## EXECUTION

### Step 0: Detect Test Framework

Check project for existing test framework:

- Look for `package.json` dependencies (playwright, jest, vitest, cypress, etc.)
- Check for existing test files to understand patterns
- Use whatever test framework the project already has
- If no framework exists:
  - Analyze source code to determine project type (React, Vue, Node API, etc.)
  - Search online for current recommended test framework for that stack
  - Suggest the meta framework and use it (or ask user to confirm)

### Step 1: Identify Features

Ask user what to test:

- Specific feature/component name
- Directory to scan (e.g., `src/components/`)
- Or auto-discover features in the codebase

### Step 2: Generate API Tests (if applicable)

For API endpoints/services, generate tests that:

- Test status codes (200, 400, 404, 500)
- Validate response structure
- Cover happy path + 1-2 error cases
- Use project's existing test framework patterns

### Step 3: Generate E2E Tests (if UI exists)

For UI features, generate tests that:

- Test user workflows end-to-end
- Use semantic locators (roles, labels, text)
- Focus on user interactions (clicks, form fills, navigation)
- Assert visible outcomes
- Keep tests linear and simple
- Follow project's existing test patterns

### Step 4: Run Tests

Execute tests to verify they pass (use project's test command).

If failures occur, fix them immediately.

### Step 5: Create Summary

Output markdown summary:

```markdown
# Test Automation Summary

## Generated Tests

### API Tests
- [x] tests/api/endpoint.spec.ts - Endpoint validation

### E2E Tests
- [x] tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts - User workflow

## Coverage
- API endpoints: 5/10 covered
- UI features: 3/8 covered

## Next Steps
- Run tests in CI
- Add more edge cases as needed
```

## Keep It Simple

**Do:**

- Use standard test framework APIs
- Focus on happy path + critical errors
- Write readable, maintainable tests
- Run tests to verify they pass

**Avoid:**

- Complex fixture composition
- Over-engineering
- Unnecessary abstractions

**For Advanced Features:**

If the project needs:

- Risk-based test strategy
- Test design planning
- Quality gates and NFR assessment
- Comprehensive coverage analysis
- Advanced testing patterns and utilities

> **Install Test Architect (TEA) module**: <https://evo-code-org.github.io/evo-method-test-architecture-enterprise/>

## Output

Save summary to: `{default_output_file}`

**Done!** Tests generated and verified. Validate against `{checklist}`.
