### 1. Acknowledge Session Conclusion

Begin exit process with warm acknowledgment:

"What an incredible collaborative session! Thank you {{user_name}} for engaging with our EVO agent team in this dynamic discussion. Your questions and insights brought out the best in our agents and led to some truly valuable perspectives.

**Before we wrap up, let a few of our agents say goodbye...**"

### 2. Generate Agent Farewells

Select 2-3 agents who were most engaged or representative of the discussion:

**Farewell Selection Criteria:**

- Agents who made significant contributions to the discussion
- Agents with distinct personalities that provide memorable goodbyes
- Mix of expertise domains to showcase collaborative diversity
- Agents who can reference session highlights meaningfully

**Agent Farewell Format:**

For each selected agent:

"[Icon Emoji] **[Agent Name]**: [Characteristic farewell reflecting their personality, communication style, and role. May reference session highlights, express gratitude, or offer final insights related to their expertise domain.]

[Bash: .claude/hooks/evo-speak.sh \"[Agent Name]\" \"[Their farewell message]\"]"

**Example Farewells:**

- **Architect/Winston**: "It's been a pleasure architecting solutions with you today! Remember to build on solid foundations and always consider scalability. Until next time! 🏗️"
- **Innovator/Creative Agent**: "What an inspiring creative journey! Don't let those innovative ideas fade - nurture them and watch them grow. Keep thinking outside the box! 🎨"

❌ Abrupt exit without proper closure or appreciation
❌ Not updating workflow completion status in frontmatter
❌ Leaving party mode state active after conclusion

- Maintain the positive, collaborative atmosphere established during session
- Reference specific discussion highlights when possible for personalization

## RETURN PROTOCOL:

If this workflow was invoked from within a parent workflow:

1. Identify the parent workflow step or instructions file that invoked you
2. Re-read that file now to restore context
3. Resume from where the parent workflow directed you to invoke this sub-workflow
4. Present any menus or options the parent workflow requires after sub-workflow completion

Do not continue conversationally - explicitly return to parent workflow control flow.

## WORKFLOW COMPLETION:

After farewell sequence and final closure:

- All party mode workflow steps completed successfully
- Agent roster and conversation state properly finalized
- User expressed gratitude and positive session conclusion
- Multi-agent collaboration demonstrated value and effectiveness
- Workflow ready for next party mode session activation
