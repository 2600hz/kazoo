### I know (or am learning) Erlang! How do I help with Kazoo?

* Clone the repo
  * If you're completely new to Git, read Github's [great introduction](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to forking repos
* Squash a bug, build a feature, etc
  * Browse the [ticket queue](https://2600hz.atlassian.net/browse/KAZOO) and find one you'd like to tackle.
  * Feel free to drop a line to the [dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/2600hz-dev) letting us know you're taking on a ticket, especially if you have questions.
