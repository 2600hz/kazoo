# Kazoo Installation Guide

This is a guide to building Kazoo from source on a Debian 8 (Jessie) base installation. Other GNU/Linux distros should work similarly, though the dependencies may differ a bit. If you want to just install and use Kazoo (and not build it) try using the [installation instructions](https://docs.2600hz.com/sysadmin/doc/install/install_via_centos7/). The rest of this guide assumes you want to run a development environment for Kazoo.

If your development is on macOS, here are [extra steps](https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo/blob/master/doc/engineering/installing-on-mac.md) for set up.

## Dependencies


### Packages Required

#### Debian 9
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential libxslt-dev \
     zip unzip expat zlib1g-dev libssl-dev curl \
     libncurses5-dev git-core libexpat1-dev \
     htmldoc
```

#### CentOS 7
```shell
sudo yum install openssl-devel automake autoconf ncurses-devel gcc python-pip fop
```

Note: `htmldoc` is required only if [you want to be able to download PDFs](./announcements.md#company-directory-pdf).

1.  Docs-related

    When running `make docs`, some Python libraries are useful:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-yaml
    sudo pip install mkdocs mkdocs-bootstrap mkdocs-bootswatch pymdown-extensions
    ```

    You can also run a local version of the docs with `make docs-serve` which will start a local server so you can view how the docs are rendered.

    If you have a custom theme, you can copy it to `doc/mkdocs/theme` and build the docs again. When you serve the docs the theme should have been applied to the site.


### Erlang

Kazoo 5.x targets Erlang 21+ (specifically 21.3 but consult [`make/erlang_version`](https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo/blob/master/make/erlang_version) to be sure). There are a couple ways to install Erlang:

1.  From Source

    I prefer to use a tool like [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) to manage my installations. If you want to play around with multiple versions of Erlang while hacking on Kazoo, this is probably the best way.

```shell
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerl/kerl/master/kerl
    chmod +x kerl
    mv kerl /usr/bin
    kerl list releases
    kerl build 21.3 21.3 # this takes a while
    kerl install 21.3 /usr/local/otp-21.3
    . /usr/local/otp-19.3/activate
```

You will probably want to add the `activate` command to your `.bashrc` or similar to make sure the proper OTP version is running.

2.  Erlang Solutions

    Install from the [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html) packages. These tend to be kept up-to-date better than the default distro's packages.


## Building Kazoo


### Short version

```shell
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/2600Hz/kazoo.git
cd kazoo
make
```


### Longer version

1.  Clone the Kazoo repo:

    ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/2600Hz/kazoo.git
    ```

2.  Build Kazoo:

    ```shell
    cd kazoo
    make
    ```

3.  Additional make targets

    When developing, one can `cd` into any app directory (within `applications/` or `core/`) and run:

    -   `make` (`make all` or `make clean`)
    -   `make xref` to look for calls to undefined functions (uses [Xref](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/tools/xref_chapter.html))
    -   `make dialyze` to statically type-check the app (uses [Dialyzer](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html))
    -   `make test` runs the app / sub-apps test suite, if any.
        -   **Note:** make sure to `make clean all` after running your tests, as test BEAMs are generated in `ebin/`!

4.  Running the tests

    To run the full test suite it is advised to:

    1.  `cd` into the root of the project
    2.  `make compile-test` to compile every app with the `TEST` macro defined
        -   *This way apps can call code from other apps in a kind of `TEST` mode*

    3.  `make eunit` (instead of `make test`) to run the test suite without recompiling each app
    4.  `make proper` to run the test suite, including property-based tests (uses [PropEr](https://github.com/manopapad/proper))

5.  Generate an Erlang release

    `make build-release` will generate a [deployable release](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/release-is-the-word)

    -   [More on using releases with Kazoo](https://github.com/2600Hz/kazoo/blob/master/doc/engineering/releases.md)

6.  Generate an Erlang development release

    `make build-dev-release` will generate a development release.

7.  Start an Erlang development release

    CouchDB2 and RabbitMQ server have to be up and running prior to start Kazoo. The Development Environment Dependency section describes how these components should be built or installed.

    `make release REL=<node name>` will start Kazoo dev release with an Erlang shell accessible.

    The node name will become the longname in distributed Erlang, therefore, it is very important to set up local domain or DNS to resolve FQDN. To verify long name resolution, `erl -name test` should be able to start an Erlang shell with `node@fqdn` as the prompt. It's not uncommon for a dev machine without DNS set up that can result `erl -name test` to crash, which has been seen on Mac.

    After the dev shell starts, we can verify Kazoo's epmd registration with the proper longname by this command under Kazoo Erlang shell expected to return a valid port instead of `noport`.
    `erlang-shell> erl_epmd:port_please("<your node name>", "<fqdn of the server>").

## SUP

The SUP command (`sup`) is found under `core/sup/priv/sup` and should be copied or symlinked to `/usr/bin/sup` (or somewhere in your `$PATH`). It is a shell file that calls `sup.escript`.

```shell
sudo ln -s core/sup/priv/sup /usr/bin/sup
```

Make sure that the path to Kazoo's installation directory is right (in `/usr/bin/sup`). Otherwise you can change it by setting the `KAZOO_ROOT` environment variable (not set by default). If one needs `KAZOO_ROOT`, an alias should be created:

```shell
alias sup='KAZOO_ROOT=/opt/kazoo sup'
```

1.  Auto-completion

    `make sup_completion` creates `sup.bash`: a Bash completion file for the SUP command

    -   Copy or symlink this file to `/etc/bash_completion.d/sup.bash`

## Development Environment Dependency
Other dependencies include CouchDB and RabbitMQ. `yum` or `apt` install rabbitmq-server is sufficient. We recommend to clone the latest [CouchDB 2](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/) and follow [the build instructions](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/INSTALL.Unix.md).

To run a cluster of CouchDB nodes, please `yum` or `apt` install haproxy.

To start out fresh, we recommend to run admin party with CouchDB that allows request to be made by anyone without user credential authentication. This is an example command to start 3 nodes cluster with haproxy automatically started and admin party enabled.

```shell
dev/run --with-admin-party-please -n 3 --with-haproxy
```

Once CouchDB, rabbitmq-server, and kazoo are all started. You should be able to verify their names registered with epmd with this command.

```shell
epmd -names
```
