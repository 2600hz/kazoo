# Call Recording

## About Call Recording

Setting up call recording allows you to have a permanent record of a conversation that took place.

## Configuring Call Recording

Call recording can be enabled in a number of ways:

* At the account level
* At the user level
* At the device level
* Explicitly as a callflow action

Call recording also requires you to have a web server capable of receiving an HTTP PUT request with the contents of the recording. You are then free to save the recording in a way that meets your needs.

### Account, User, or Device

Configuring recording at the account level means all calls, inbound and outbound, to this account will start the call recording system.

Configuring recording at the user level starts recording for any calls to/from a device owned by that user.

Configuring recording at the device level starts recording for any calls to/from the device.

#### Precedence of settings

Precedence of settings is: Device > User

If a user turns on call recording but a device has explicitly disabled it, the device will not be recorded when the user makes a call with it. If the device's settings are left undefined, the user's settings will be applied.

The account's settings are considered independently of the endpoint's. So a user who has disabled recording, within an account that has enabled recording, will still have calls recorded according to the account's settings.

#### Enabling recording

To enable call recording, add `"call_recording":{...}` to the document of choice. For example, if you have a user with user ID of `{USER_ID}`, you can patch the user's document using Crossbar:

```shell
curl -v -X PATCH \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"data":{
    "call_recording":{...}
    }}' \
    http://{SERVER}:8000/v2/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/users/{USER_ID}
```

#### Concrete example

Sales wants calls to and from customers to be recorded but not calls within the account. The sales users would have their `call_recording` settings set as:

```json
{"id":"{USER_ID}"
 ,"call_recording":{
   "inbound":{
     "offnet":{
       ...recording settings...
     }
   }
   ,"outbound":{
     "offnet":{
       ...recording settings...
     }
   }
 }
}
```
