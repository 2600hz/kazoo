System Config

** The =system_config= situation                                    :B_frame:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_opt: allowframebreaks,label=
   :BEAMER_env: frame

*** Strategy
 - Keep as little on disk as is possible
 - Load most items from the database
 - But we have to know how to connect to the database
 - Some components must be configured from files
   - This list is rapidly shrinking
 - The rest is stored in the database

*** =/etc/kazoo=
 - All component configuration is stored in =/etc/kazoo=
 - These files are installed via the RPM/DEB
   - Watch out for =.rpmnew= when updating!
 - We avoid updating these files as much as possible
 - System specific configuration are in their own files
   - Easier upgrades

*** Operating system configs
There are additional linux configurations added:
 - =/etc/logrotate.d=
 - =/etc/rsyslog.d=
 - =/etc/security/limits.d=
 - Also init scripts
 - Currently all targeted to CentOS; Debian-compatible mostly

** The =system_config= database                                     :B_frame:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_opt: allowframebreaks,label=
   :BEAMER_env: frame
   :END:

*** What's stored in there?
 - Kazoo and some component settings
 - Most documents are named after the corresponding App
 - Some confusion on how these work; let’s clear that up first

*** Settings are created on-demand
 - You can add them prior to creation

*** All settings added with a default value
 - New properties added with a value to maintain backward compatibility

*** "default" object
 - These settings apply to the entire cluster

*** Override sections
 - Check for node-specific object first
 - Check for zone-specific object next
 - Check "default" object lastly

*** Example: =system_config.ecallmgr=
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
   "_id": "ecallmgr",
   "ecallmgr@apps001-qa.2600hz.com": {
       "fs_nodes": [ “freeswitch@fs001-qa.2600hz.com” ]
   },
   "qa-east":{
       "fs_nodes": ["freeswitch@fs001-qa.2600hz.com",“freeswitch@fs002-qa.2600hz.com”]
   },
   "default": {
       "fs_nodes": [ ]
   }
}
#+END_SRC

*** Commonly modified documents
 - ecallmgr
 - =kapps_controller=
 - =media_mgr=

*** Lets look at these now!
 - Navigate to [[http://ip.add.re.ss:5984/_utils/database.html?system_config][the =system_config= db]]

*** Number manager is the most often misunderstood
 - This gets a section of its own

** Number Manager Configuration                                     :B_frame:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_opt: allowframebreaks,label=
   :BEAMER_env: frame
   :END:

*** =carrier_modules=
 - List of Kazoo Number Manager modules used to interact with a carrier
 - There are two special modules
   - =knm_local=: Untrusted numbers added locally to an account (BYOC)
   - =knm_other=: Trusted numbers that are managed by an external system
 - [[https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo/tree/master/core/kazoo_number_manager/src/carriers][Other modules]] exist, some of which utilize carriers APIs

*** providers
 - List of [[https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo/tree/master/core/kazoo_number_manager/src/providers][modules]] that provide supplemental services to numbers
 - For example:
   - E911: Connects to Dash or Vitelity E911 API
   - Porting: Sends port request emails
   - CNAM: Sends CNAM update request emails

*** =reconcile_regex=
 - Used to differentiate PSTN numbers from extensions
 - For example:
   - It should match a US number like +14158867938
   - It should NOT match a extension number like 7938
 - Numbers that match are stored in the numbers/XXXXX databases
 - These databases are used to determine which account a number belongs to when a unchallenged SIP INVITE is received (carrier ACL)

*** =e164_converters=
 - The converters ensure all numbers are processed in the same format
 - Should be able to normalize any format your carriers may present
 - For example:
   - 4158867900 and 14158867900 should convert to +14158867900
 - Does not necessarily have to be e.164, as long as its consistent
 - Should be changed with extreme care on live systems!

*** classifiers
 - A set of regular expressions to identify a number "type"
 - Could be thought of as a way to avoid copying a regex to match, say US DIDs, all over the system
 - Used to restrict number types, such as "international"
 - The type "emergency" will trigger additional outbound logic
 - Can be changed at any time safely

*** More details
 - Read more about [[https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo/blob/master/doc/internationalization/numbers.md][numbers]] and how to properly configure your system

** Sysconf Application
 - Not all applications connect to the database
 - Your application, written in Python, may not use BigCouch
 - Those that don’t need configuration too
 - Sysconf answers requests for configuration via AMQP
 - Should be run in Erlang virtual machines that are connected to CouchDB

** Kazoo Caches                                                     :B_frame:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_opt: allowframebreaks,label=
   :BEAMER_env: frame
   :END:

*** Configuration values are cached when fetched
 - Typical manual flush commands:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $> sup kz_datamgr flush_cache_docs
   $> sup kapps_config flush
   $> sup ecallmgr_config flush
   #+END_EXAMPLE
 - Only needed when manual changes to the database are made
 - Should use APIs or SUP instead
