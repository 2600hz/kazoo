### Callflow

The callflow application takes care of receiving incoming phone calls, identifying the callflow associated with the number dialed, and executing the configured callflow JSON structure. There are numerous callflow [actions](https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo/tree/master/applications/callflow/src/module) available that you can reference when building your own.
