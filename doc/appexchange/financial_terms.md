# Financial Terms
* Refunds 
    * Customers go through 2600Hz for refunds. 2600Hz offers refunds for thirty (30) days after purchase. Refunds aren’t allowed after that thirty days has elapsed. Customers contact 2600Hz to request a refund, since refunds can’t be issued directly by vendors.
    
* % cut 
    * We keep it simple. 75% of the revenue goes to you, the developer, and 25% goes to us at 2600Hz. In more complicated scenarios, for example if you let <comarketing campaign> resell your application at a 20% discount, we break up the revenue after the discount. 
     
     * For example, consider an application that is priced at $100.00:
        * In a standard (non-Solution Partner) sale, the customer pays $100, of which you keep $75 and 2600Hz keeps $25.
        * In a <comarketing campaign> sale, the customer pays $80, of which you keep $60 and 2600Hz keeps $20.
    
* Renewals 
    * Our renewal system automatically notifies customers when application licenses are about to expire. A customer can renew in advance of expiration to ensure uninterrupted access to support and software updates.
    
* Returns 
    * Customers go through 2600Hz for refunds. 2600Hz offers refunds for thirty (30) days after purchase. Refunds aren’t allowed after that thirty days has elapsed. Customers contact 2600Hz to request a refund, since refunds can’t be issued directly by vendors.
