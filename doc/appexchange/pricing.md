# Choosing your price model
### One-time license
This is a one time charge that clients will pay in order to gain access to your application.

### Subscription based model
This is a monthly recurring charge that clients will be required to pay once per calendar month.

### Free Applications
This is a free of charge application. 

# In App Purchases
Any external elements that your application requires and is not free must be explicitly stated. If your application is free, it must provide some value to the platform, “as is”. If your application requires a subscription based payment, both the recurring payment date and amount must be visible and presented to the user.

# Pricing your application competitively
In order for your application to succeed in the exchange, it is necessary that you price your application competitively. Find similar applications on the market, determine where your functionality lies in comparison to those applications, and decide a value point on each of those features.
