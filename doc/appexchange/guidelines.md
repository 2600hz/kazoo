# Quality Assurance Approval Guide
### Provide marketing assets
Any marketing material required for the sale or marketing on the App Exchange platform must be included. It is recommended that any other marketing material (email, social media, etc) also be included.
### Reasonable pricing
Your application should be competitively priced against competitors.
### Performs functions described
Applications should perform all tasks described while advertising. 
### Provide documentation
Clear and thorough documentation must be provided with all application submissions. This documentation needs to include how to configure and use your application.
### Doesn’t break Monster UI
Any application on the App Exchange must not break the Monster UI framework.
### Doesn’t degrade system performance
### Doesn’t infringe on whitelabeled or 2600Hz trademarks
Any infringement on whitelabeled or 2600Hz trademarks will receive immediate rejection during the application approval process. Any usage of 2600Hz trademarks is listed in the 2600Hz Style Guide.
### No advertisements
Your application should not list external services. You can mention paid versions of the same app or products that complement your app. In the host application, your app should abide by the same rules. Reminders for upgrades, complementary products, or additional features are acceptable. We recommend placing these reminders in configuration screens.
### Open-source solutions must have a source code openly available
If your application is open-source, ensure that your source code is publicly available.
### Pricing and all further charges must be clear
Any external elements that your application requires and is not free must be explicitly stated. If your application is free, it must provide some value to the platform, “as is”. If your application requires a subscription based payment, both the recurring payment date and amount must be visible and presented to the user.
### Any external elements must be explicit
Under the condition that your application requires an external element to function, the element itself and any data that it requires must be visible and presented to the user.
### Secure authentication
Whilst your app may make use of Basic authentication for ease of development/speed during development, this shall not be the case for any public, approved app. Additionally, shared secrets from customer-installed apps shall be stored in a secure manner.
### No duplicate listings
