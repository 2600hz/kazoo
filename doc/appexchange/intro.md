# Welcome to the 2600Hz Marketplace

The 2600Hz Marketplace is a standalone web portal that showcases KAZOO applications, integrations and services developed for and by communications experts. This is the realization of our past vision of developing an app exchange system for KAZOO users.

In the immediate term, KAZOO developers, resellers, and partners will be able to review apps and details about the apps that have been developed for the KAZOO platform by 2600Hz. Existing Global Infrastructure and Private Cloud customers will be able to use their ZSwitch accounts to purchase these apps and deliver them to their KAZOO cluster.

In the coming months, we will be rolling out broader access for developers to submit and sell their own applications, as well as purchase and deploy both 2600Hz and thrid-party applications from a single resource. Our aim for the Marketplace is that it provides a place for developers to monetize their work and share solutions theyâ€™ve crafted.

In addition, the Marketplace is a resource for the community to showcase and share their own KAZOO stories, learn about events related to the KAZOO architecture, access API docs and training videos. is a community of third-party developers who want to build and publish applications on the Kazoo platform. If you're involved with KAZOO and are interested in sharing your story, please contact Clay at [clay@2600hz.com](mailto:clay@2600hz.com).
