# What Can You Build?
Using the power of Kazoo’s API system, developers are free to build any telecom application they can dream of. We’ve started out our platform with the reseller in mind: how can we present something that is both customizable and can scale to their clients needs? 

Everything from a full-blown Call Center application to something as simple as a contact list: there are no limitations.
