##States 
There are four primary states your application can exist in:

* **Drafts** - Drafts are saved, un-submitted applications. These may be applications that you have not finished submitting and selected the Save as Draft option in the wizard.
* **Under Review** - These are applications you’ve successfully submitted to 2600Hz for review. The average processing time for applications is 2-3 business weeks.
* **Unpublished** - This state is for applications that have been approved by the 2600Hz team for publication to the App Exchange. Applications can exist here either because a team has decided to not launch their application quite yet, or they simply haven’t manually published the application.
* **Published on Marketplace** - Any application that is live and can be seen/downloaded by users on the App Exchange

There are also two specialty states:

* **Denied** - Applications which do not pass the 2600Hz QA checklist will be denied and placed into this state. An email will be sent to the primary contact provided for the application on why the application was denied.
* **Revoked** - Applications which have been removed from the App Exchange will be placed in the Revoked state. An email will be sent to the primary contact provided for the application on why the application was revoked.

##Workflows

**Standard Submission Workflow**

1. Application is submitted via App Exchange Submission Wizard 
2. 2600Hz QA Team reviews application (see [App Guidelines](https://docs.2600hz.com/supported/doc/appexchange/guidelines/))
3. Application is approved and moves into Unpublished state
4. Submitter clicks Publish to Marketplace 
5. Application is available on the 2600Hz App Exchange

**Standard Version Update Workflow**

1. Submitter opens App card for application they wish to update
2. Submitter clicks Submit Update
3. Application is submitted via App Exchange Submission Wizard

Anytime an application is revoked or denied the submitter has the option to revise their submission (in case of denial), or submit an update (in case of revoke).
