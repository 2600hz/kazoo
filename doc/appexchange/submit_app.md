### How to submit your application

1. Log in to the Kazoo portal.
2. Navigate to the “My Apps” application.
3. Click the “Submit” tab at the top of the window.
4. Fill out the application information: Project name, SKU, choose a pricing model and set a price, select a primary language, select which environment your application was built against, provide a technical contact, a support link, and if your project is open-source, a link to where your code is publicly maintained. 
    * Optionally, you can choose to participate in our co-marketing campaigns. This will require you to provide a little information about your company, about your application, a marketing personnel contact, and any marketing assets you would like used in campaigns.
6. Upload your packaged source code in .tar format.
7. Click "Submit".

At any point in this process, you can click “Save” and save a working draft of your submission. The application dashboard will show which sections are complete and ready for submission.
