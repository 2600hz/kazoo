# How do my customers pay?
### Paid via 2600Hz
Customers pay a fee to use your application. Customers evaluate and purchase these applications directly from 2600Hz. Paid via 2600Hz applications use the 2600Hz Licensing API. 2600Hz provides automated sales and licensing reports to you as a vendor.

# How do I get paid?
### Payment to Developer
2600Hz owes you remittance for your sales after you reach $250 USD in profit. We pay you within 30 days after the end of the month in which you accrue $250+ USD in profit. This means that we pay you within a minimum of 30 days from the time of sale, and no more than 60 days after. We designed this time frame around customer support needs, refunds, and chargebacks (payment disputes). After 30 days, we donâ€™t grant refund requests to customers.
