## Packaging Your App
In order to properly deliver your application to 2600Hz there are several key data points that we require:
* A packaged .tar file containing your applications source code
* Which languages you are looking to support
* A pricing model for your application: monthly subscription based, one-time licensing fee, or free
* A technical contact for the 2600Hz team to reach out to in case questions arise during the Quality Assurance check
* A support model that you can maintain. This can be either an external link to your companies forums or a telephone line clients can call to troubleshoot problems while using your application. We at 2600Hz cannot provide support for your application once it passes our QA processâ€”ensuring that you maintain an open line of communication between yourself and your users will only help advance your applications use.
