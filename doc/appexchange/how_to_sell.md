# How To Sell Your Application
The most important aspect of the community driven App Exchange is ensuring that both contributors and consumers feel the exchange is a balanced, fairly priced channel. For this reason it is imperative that, as a developer, your application has features properly documented and pricing is competitive. While you are in charge of the content and price that you set for your application, 2600Hz has the responsibility to maintain the overall content of the exchange to ensure that there are quality, fairly priced applications.

Providing detailed documentation and reasonable pricing will help drive sales of your application. It is important to keep this in mind during the overall design and development phases of your development
