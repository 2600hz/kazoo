## Working with `git` in multi-repo

As you work with multi-repo, especially when your code changes involves many apps or even the core, you start noticing some repetitive tasks like commit and push and updating the pull requests.

For making these kind of task more tolerable, there is small and handy `kgit` shell script which wraps around Git command. You simply give this script the directory name of an app (or multiple apps) and the git command you want to run against them and it loop over the folders and run the command. This script can also used together with `gh` [the official GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) or `hub` [an unofficial GitHub CLI](https://github.com/github/hub) (which is more mature and powerful and it also wraps `git`) commands.

The script tries to not get in your way and offers running `git` and other commands like normal command.

Welcome to   /____/ the FUTURE

A simple wrapper around git and pull request commands
to provide an easy way to develop on Kazoo multi-repo structure

Usage:

        kgit.sh [OPTIONS]+ <ACTION> [ACTION_ARGS]+

    Where ACTION can be one of these commands to run in specified
    Kazoo source folders:

        git        Runs git command
        gh         Runs gh command (https://cli.github.com)
        hub        Runs hub command (https://github.com/github/hub)

Example:

    kgit.sh -kapps crossbar,teletype git status --branch --short

Options:

    -kapps app_name[,app_name...]    add a comma separated list of Kazoo apps to working directories list
    -kcore                           add "core" directory to working directories list
    -kroot                           add kazoo source root directory to working directories list
    -a, --all-apps                   add all Kazoo apps to working directories list
    -A, -All                         add "core", all kazoo apps and kazoo source root directory to
                                         list of working directories. This option is default
    -exit-on-error                   exit if command returns exit other than 0
    -kchanged                        loop over working directories and prints the name of files which are
                                         different than "$BASE_BRANCH". "master" is the default BASE_BRANCH
                                     this does not run git/hub/gh commands
    -get-root                        print path to Kazoo source directory and exit
    -q                               be quiet, but still print error messages
    -qq                              be more quiet, also do not print errors
    -help                            shows help
```


It is recommended to sym-link this script to `kgit` and put it in your path. `kgit-completion.bash` provides bash completion for `kgit`. You can source this directly in your shell or add to your `~/.bashrc`.

### Some useful examples for working with `kgit`

```shell
# pull all apps
$ kgit -a git pull

# run git status in all directories
$ kgit git status

# too noisy output, huh? make it short:
$ kgit git status --branch -s

# some git subcommands use pager, you can trun this off by "--no-pager"
# see latest commit message for core, crossbar, stepswitch and teletype
$ kgit -kcore -kapps crossbar,stepswitch,teletype git --no-pager log -1

# make it less noisy
$ kgit -q -kcore -kapps crossbar,stepswitch,teletype git --no-pager log -1 --format

# commit all changes just for core and root directory
# this will opens up your editor for each directory for commit message
# you can use "-m" to add message. you can even add multiple "-m" which converts
# each one to a paragraph
$ kgit -kcore -kroot git commit -a

# commit all changes in all directories with "kazoo is great" as commit title
# and "my explaination" as commit body
# kgit git commit -a -m "kazoo is great" -m "my explaination"

# commit all changes in all directories with a message authored in a external file
# please refer to git manual for format of the file
$ vim /tmp/commit-message.txt
$ kgit git commit -a -F /tmp/commit-message.txt
```

### Examples for working with pull-requests

!!! note
    These are just example to show you the new work flow. Please adjust it to your work flow.

!!! note
    For simplicity we are applying the command to all directories. Obviously you can adjust to work with directory that you need, using `-kapps`, `--all-apps`, `-kcore` or `-kroot` accordingly.

```shell
# forking all using hub
# Note: hub after forking is adding a git remote for it to each dir
# please refer to hub documentation for more info
$ make fetch-apps fetch-core
$ kgit hub fork

# create a new branch in all dirs
$ kgit git checkout -b my_new_branch

# start hacking!, add/remove or update some files
#

# after coding, commit your changes to the your branch
$ kgit git commit -a -m "make kazoo even better"

# push your codes to your forked repos
$ kgit git push --set-upstream origin my_new_branch

# finally create pull requests for all changed repos
$ vim /tmp/pr-message.txt
$ kgit hub pull-request -F /tmp/pr-message.txt

# after a few mintues check PRs for their CI checks
$ kgit hub ci-status
```
