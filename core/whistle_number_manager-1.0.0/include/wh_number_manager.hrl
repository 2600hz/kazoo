%%% NUMBER STATES
%%% discovery    - The number was discovered via a carrier lookup but has not been reserved or purchased.
%%%                Numbers in this state should be cleared out on a cleanup period (every 2 hours or so)
%%% avaliable    - The number belongs to the system admins and is routed to the cluster but is not assigned
%%%                to any account.
%%% reserved     - The number has been added to the routing table for a specific account and only it can
%%%                claim the number.
%%% in_service   - The number currently routes to an account
%%% released     - The number was mapped to an account but they have released it, after a period of time
%%%                it will be moved to avaliable or cancled with the carrier.
%%% disconnected - Number is being ported or cancelled
%%% cancelled    - Number has been cancelled with the carrier and will be removed from the system
