# kazoo Speech

This core library governs interations with [Text-to-Speech (TTS) providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis) and with (Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition] to allow Kazoo callflows to take advantage of the advanced functionality these provide.

## TTS

Kazoo, by default, will use the internal [mod_flite](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/mod_flite) to play the text from a [TTS callflow action](../../../applications/callflow/doc/tts.md).

## ASR
