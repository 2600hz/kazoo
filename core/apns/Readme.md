Example
=======

Using apns4erl is quite simple. First, setup something similar to this in your sys.config:

```erlang
    {apns, [
      {apple_host, "gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com"},
      {apple_port, 2195},
      {cert_file, "/etc/certs/mycert_dev.pem"},
      {key_file, undefined},
      {cert_password, undefined},
      {timeout, 30000},
      {feedback_port, 2196},
      {feedback_host, "feedback.sandbox.push.apple.com"},
      {feedback_timeout, 18000000}
    ]}
```

**NOTE**: The *apple_host* to use will depend on your environment (production or development). Remember to always use the **correct** certificate, device tokens, and apns hostname for production or development environments.

**NOTE 2**: To generate the .pem file, from the .cer an .p12 files provided by Apple, you can use [this script](/inaka/apns4erl/blob/master/priv/test_certs)

Then, once you've started the apns application, you can connect to the APNS network using:

```erlang
      apns:connect(
        %% your connection identifier:
        my_connection_name,
        %% called in case of a "hard" error:
        fun ?MODULE:handle_apns_error/2,
        %% called if the device uninstalled the application:
        fun ?MODULE:handle_apns_delete_subscription/1
      ).
```

As a result, you will get a tuple:

 * ``{ok, Pid}``
 * ``{error, {already_started, Pid}}``
 * ``{error, Reason}``

**Pid** is the Pid of the [apns_connection](/inaka/apns4erl/blob/master/src/apns_connection.erl) process spawned to handle the connection.

**CAUTION**: It is **highly recommended** to pass a fully qualified function for
callbacks, using the ``fun M:F/A`` syntax. If you pass in a local fun
using ``fun F/A``, any subsequent code upgrades to the module where
that local fun was defined, will cause the code server to kill processes
that are holding on to references to the old code (eg. the apns
connection processes, thus killing the apns4erl application).

To send a notification
======================
    apns:send_message(my_connection_name, "this_is_a_valid_device_token", "hello world").

That's it!

A little more about what's going on
===================================
Actually, send\_message/3, send\_message/4, send\_message/5, send\_message/6, send\_message/7, and send\_message/8 are calling send\_message/2, which takes a **#apns\_msg** record as its 2nd argument. Thus, you can also create the message customized with your own needs, by using a **#apns\_msg** record:

```erlang
    -include_lib("apns/include/apns.hrl").

    apns:send_message(my_connection_name, #apns_msg{
      alert  = "alert" ,
      badge  = 1,
      sound  = "sound" ,
      expiry = 1348000749,
      device_token = "this_is_a_valid_device_token"
    }).
```

Feedback Channel and Getting Errors
===================================
Notice how we are passing 2 funs to the connect function. These are used as callbacks:

If there was an error while sending a message, the first fun will be called.

If there were no errors, but Apple reported that the user removed the application from the device, the 2nd fun will be used (this is effectively the feedback channel).

```erlang
    handle_apns_error(MsgId, Status) ->
      error_logger:error_msg("error: ~p - ~p~n", [MsgId, Status]).

    handle_apns_delete_subscription(Data) ->
      error_logger:info_msg("delete subscription: ~p~n", [Data]).
```

Passing Keys and Certificates Directly
======================================

By default, the private key and certificate to use to connect to
Apple's servers are loaded out of the PEM-encoded files specified in
`cert_file` and `key_file`. However, if you prefer to store these
elsewhere and load them manually, you can pass DER-encoded binaries
when connecting:

```erlang
    CertBin = <<"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"...>>, % perhaps from a database
    KeyBin = <<"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"...>>,
    [{'Certificate', CertDER, not_encrypted}] = public_key:pem_decode(CertBin),
    [{'RSAPrivateKey', KeyDER, not_encrypted}] = public_key:pem_decode(KeyBin),
    Connection = #apns_connection{cert_file=undefined,
                                  cert=CertDER,
                                  key={'RSAPrivateKey', KeyDER}},
    apns:connect(Connection).
```

If you store your key and certificate as DER binaries, you can pass
them directly without any decoding.
