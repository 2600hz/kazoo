# Kazoo IP Addresses *Manages Dedicated IP Addresses*

## Purpose
The purpose of the Kazoo IPs library is to track IP addresses owned by system administrators and provided to clients for inbound routing assignments.

## Overview
The Kazoo IPs library creates and manages a database called dedicated_ips.  Each document of this database represents an IP address added by the system administrators and potentially assigned to accounts.  These assignments are used by the account admins to route inbound numbers when using their own carriers.
